    <p>203.</p>
    <p>We will insist on some species:</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) such as are made up of a title + the noun of its bearer, as [AryacANakyaH] (Sir Câṇakya),　[amAtyarAkSasaH] (Minister Râxasa). So Utt. II, p. 30 [kumAralakSmaNaH] (Prince L.), Mâlav. I, p. 24 [paNDitakauzikI khalu bhavatI] (you are the learned Kauçikî, are not you ?), Mrcch. III, p. 115 [ahaM hi gANikAmadanikArthamakAryamanutiSThAmi], but some lines after (p. 116) we read in inverse order [madanikAgaNikArthe], cp. Panc. 59 [anena viSNujAmAtRprabhAveNa sarve atravo nihatAH], here the proper noun [viSNu] is followed, not preceded by its epithet. In some cases the latter idiom seems to be the regular one, as [vindhyAcalaH] (Mount Vindhya).</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) those ending in [-jana], the former part being a subst., as [strIjanaH], [duhitRjanaH], [gurujanaH]. Here [jana] has sometimes the power of a collective, sometimes it denotes the individual (19 R), [strIjanaH] may be = »womankind,” »women” or even one »woman,” and so on;</p>
    <p><i>c.</span>) the type [ardhapippalI] (half a pepper). It is not allowed to say [pippalyardham], but [pippalyA ardham]; when compounded it must be [ardhapippalI] (*1). {P. 2, 2, 1 and 2.} So f. i. Ragh. 7, 42 [ardhamArga] (halfway), Panc. 203 [ardhapAdaspRSTabhUmiH] (touching the earth with the half of his foot). The same applies to [pUrva], [apara], [adhara], [uttara], etc. when denoting: the fore-part, the part behind, the lower and upper part. Therefore it is said [pUrvakAyaH] (the fore-part of the body), [pUrvAhNaH] (fore-noon), [apararAtraH] (the latter part of the night), [uttamAGgam] (head), [prathamarAtrI] (the fore-night), and the like. So [madhya] in [madhyAhnaH] = [madhyamahnaH]. We have here the same adjectival conception as in Latin <i>summus mons</span>, <i>media urbs</span>, Greek <i>μἑση ἡ πόλις</span> etc.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. [ardha], like our »half,” is also compounded with a participle or some other adjective, as [ardhoditaH sUryaH] (the sun, half-risen), Panc. 9 [ardhasphATito dArumayaH stambhaH].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. As to compounds, commencing by [dvitIya], [tRtIya], [caturtha] or [turya], when = »half, the third —, fourth part,” one may say as well [dvitIyabhikSA] as [bhikSAdvitIyam] (half an alms) and the like. {P. 2, 2, 3.} The same may be stated of [agra] (top, edge, extremity), as it is said as well [agranakha] (the edge of a nail) as [nakhAgra] (see Petr. Dict. <i>s. v.</span> and the passages adduced there <i>s. v.</span> [agra]).</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>But it is allowed to say [pippalyardhaH] (a <i>portion</span> of a pepper). Pat. I, 407 states [ardha] to be a neuter, when meaning »half,” but a masculine, when = »portion, part:” [samapravibhAge napuMsakaliGgo ‘vayavavAcI puMlliGgaH]</p>
