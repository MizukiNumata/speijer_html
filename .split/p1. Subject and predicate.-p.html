    <p>1. {Subject and predicate.}</p>
    <p>The <<b>>subject of the sentence</span>(*1) is put in the nominative case. The <<b>>predicate of the sentence</span> is either noun or verb; [aśvo dhāvati] (the horse runs), [taruṇo’śvaḥ] (the horse is young).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Vernacular grammar has no term to name the subject of the sentence or grammatical subject. The term <i>kartṛ</span> signifies the agent or <i>logical subject</span>. In the same way <i>karma</span> means the <i>logical object</span>, whatsoever may be its grammatical function; it thus implies the object of the active verb as well as the subject of the passive or the objective genitive. In such sentences as »the knife cuts”, the grammatical subject is both <i>kartṛ</span> (agent) and <i>karaṇa</span> (instrument).</p>
