    <p>10. Subject implied.</p>
    <p>The subject of the sentence is not always expressed. Often it is implied by the verb. For <skt>dadāmi} and <skt>dadāsi} are quite as intelligible as <skt>ahaṃ dadāmi} and <skt>tvaṃ dadāsi}, and likewise in the third person the sole <skt>dadāti} suffices, if there can be no doubt as to the giver meant.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the personal pronouns denoting the subject are not seldom added, even when not required for the understanding, certainly much oftener than in Latin and Greek. See f. inst. Nala. 2, 19; 3, 9; Kathâs. 6, 133. But the omission is impossible, if stress should be laid on the pronoun.</p>

    <p>{Agent implied.}</p>
    <p>In passive sentences, the personal pronouns denoting the agent may be wanting likewise, but of course this is not by far done so often as in active sentences. Panc. 127 <skt>iti niścityābhihitam} [sc. <skt>anena}], ibid. 327 <skt>bho mitra kim evaṃ palāyyate ‘līkabhayena} (say, friend, why do [you] run away thus by false fear?).</p>
    <p>The omission is regular with passive imperatives, that are expressive of an injunction or commandment in a softened or polite manner, as <skt>gamyatām} (go), <skt>śruyatām} (hear) Panc. 87 the panther thus addresses the hungry lion, his master <skt>svāmin kriyatām adya mama prāṇaiḥ prāṇayātrā / dīyatām akṣayo vāsaḥ svarge / mama vistāryataṃ kṣititale prabhūtataraṃ yaśaḥ}</p>
