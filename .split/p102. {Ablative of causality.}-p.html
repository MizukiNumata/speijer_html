    <p>102. {Ablative of causality.}</p>
    <p>Hence, the <i>cause, reason, motive by which</span>, is likewise expressed by the ablative namely as far as it is conceived as the origin or starting-point, from whence some consequence has resulted (*1).</p>
    <p>The instrumental, as we have seen formerly (<b>72</span>), may likewise serve that purpose, and in the case of feminine nouns of quality it is even obligatory. For the rest, ablative and in tr. of causality are generally interchangeable, and not seldom they are used side by side. So Kathâs. 29, 25 [harSeNa naSTAsyAH kSunna rogataH] (it is from joy she does not eat, not from illness), Mrcch. I, p. 44 [anyajanazaGkayA khalvidamanuSThitaH na darpAt] (surely, it has been done by taking her for somebody else, not by insolence). But, if the efficient cause be some <i>obligation</span> or other binding motive <i>by virtue of which</span> some effect is produced, the ablative alone is to be used (*2). Nothing impedes concrete nouns to be put in the abl. <i>of cause</span> (*3) but often they are expressed by periphrase, especially by means of [hetoH] (192).</p>
    <p>Examples. — Kathas. 27, 76 [divyAH patantyeva zApAnmAnuSayoniSu] (by consequence of a curse celestial beings are borne among men), Panc. 202 [kapiJcalaH zAlibhakSaNAdatIva], Panc. 49 [strIdharSaNAdvadhyaH] (he is to be put to death for having insulted a woman), Hit. 96 [bhayAdidamAha] (from fear he spoke thus), Ven. II, p. 39 [ayaM…prIto ‘bhimanyorvadhAt] (he is glad on account of Abh.’s death), Mrcch. I, p. 45 [] (I will stand up, on condition — ), Kathâs. 30, 112 [nAjJAyata yadA caurastadA jJAniprasiddhitaH / AnAyayAmAsa nRpo harizarmANamAzu tam] (as the thief was not found, the king sent forthwith for H. on account of the reputation of his knowledge), Panc. I, 180 [durmantrAnnRpatirnazyati yatiH saGgAtsuto lAlanAt / vipro’nadhyayanAtkulaM kutanayAt] (by bad counsel a prince comes to ruin, a holy man by wordliness, a son by spoiling, a brahman by not-studying, a family by a bad son), Çâk. I, vs. 22 [vayaM tattvAnveSAnmadhukarahatAH] (to seek after the truth [liter. by seeking — ], it is I, who have been annoyed by the bee). The examples have been selected so as to show, that the different shades of the notion of causality — <i>cause, motive, reason</span> — are promiscuously signified by the ablative.</p>
    <p>Many ablatives of causality have assumed the character</p>
    <p>of adverbs, see <b>104</span>.</p>

    <p>How easily this transition is made, will be plain by this example: Mâlav. V, p. 140 [vIrasUriti zabdo ‘yaM tanayAttvAmupasthitaH]. Literally these words signify »the name of mother of a hero” touches you <i>from the part of</span> your son,&quot; but as to their meaning they should be rather translated thus »now you deserve the name »m. of a h.” <i>because of your son</span>.” In other terms the abl. of origin is at the same time an abl. of cause.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>Pāṇini’s rule, which contains this statement, is too narrowly interpreted by the commentaries. His words [akartaryRNe paJcamI] [P. 2, 3, 24] are explained thus: the abl. [alone] is to be used, if the cause be a <i>debt</span>, provided it be not at the same time the agent; examples of which are adduced as [zatAdnabaddhaH] (he is confined for a debt of 100), whereas one must say [zatena bandhitaH] But why should we restrict <i>ṛṇa</span> to its special sense of a »debt of money&quot; and not take the more general meaning of »obligation” and »duty”? If it could be proved that [ṛṇa] implies also the notion of <i>necessity</span>, <i>ἀνάγχη</span>, the rule would be quite correct, for in the case of direct and unavoidable consequence of an efficient cause the ablative alone is to be used, even of feminine words.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>Speaking plain, neither the ablat. of bhâvavacanâni nor that of concrete nouns is allowed by Pāṇini’s rules. The sûtras 2, 3, 23-25 name the instrumental as the regular case to denote cause or motive, but with these exceptions, 1° that if the cause be a quality ([guNe]) the ablative may be used too, but for feminines [or rather — as the term [strI] is an ambiguous one — only such as have been made by the fem. endings</p>
    <p>[-ri], 2° that the cause being an <i>ṛṇa</span>, the abl. <i>must</span> be used, and not the instrum. Now, these rules do not leave any room for neither bhâvavacanâni</p>
    <p>nor concrete nouns, something very strange, because really both classes of words are put in the ablative of cause as often and as well as the gunavacanâni. See the examples adduced in the context.</p>
