    <p>103. {Ablative expressive of the side, on which.}</p>
    <p>IV. Sanskrit, just as Latin, uses the ablative not only for the sake of signifying <i>from what side</span>, but also <i>on what side</span>. Here the ending [-taH] is employed, it seems, by preference, at least in the case of indicating space and direction. So it is said [dakSiNataH] (at the right), [vAmataH] (at the left), [pArzvataH] (at the side), [pRSThataH] (at the back) etc. — In figurative sense this abl. is likewise used, as Ch. Up. 4, 17,4 [yadyRkto riSyet…yadi yajuSTaH…yadi sAmataH] (if [the yajña] would be vicious on account of an ṛc, a yajus, a sâma), Âpast. 1, 1, 15 [sa hi vidyAtastaM janayati] (v. a. for he is his spiritual father), Mâlav. I, p. 25 [madhyasthA bhagavatI nau guNadoSataH paricchettumarhati] (Your Reverence is even-handed; be you, then, the umpire to judge us with respect to our qualities and our shortcomings). {Vârtt. on P. 5, 4, 44.}</p>
    <p>In its metaphorical application this <i>ablativus partis</span> not rarely touches upon the <i>abl. causae</span>, treated in <b>102</span>. So f. i. with the points of comparison, as R. 2, 34, 9 [gAmbhIryAtsAgaropamaH] (in depth like the ocean = »by its depth” or »as to its depth”).</p>
