    <p>Ablatives of the cause and of the side often have the character of adverbs (<b>77</span>); especially when ending in [-taH]. So [svabhAvAt] or [-vataH] (by disposition), [anulomataH] (in due order), [pratilomataH] (in inverse order), [svavIryataH] (through one's own exertion), [zaktitaH] (with all one’s power), [AdarAt] (out of respect), [akasmAt] (without motive ; on a sudden), and so on. P. 2, 3, 33 gives a special rule for the ablatives [kRcchAt], [stokAt], [katipayAt], [alpAt] with being interchangeable with the instr. [kRccheNa] etc.; both sets have the character of adverbs, as [alpena] or [alpAnmuktaH] (he was released easily).</p>
