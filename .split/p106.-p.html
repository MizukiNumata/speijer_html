    <p>Observations on the abl. of comparison.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Our »than” with the comparative is to be rendered in Sanskrit by the ablative. Such restrictions, as for instance limit the faculty of using the abl. of comparison in Latin, do not exist in Sanskrit. It is impossible to say in Latin <i>dat tibi plus me</span> = »he gives to you more than to me,” but it must be said <i>plus quam mihi</span>. In Sanskrit nothing impedes such sentences as [tubhyaM dadAti matta adhikam]. So Mâlat. X, p. 164 [sneho mAturmayi samadhikastena yuktastavApi] (hence, you must bear more affection towards me, than towards your own mother).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Note the abl. with such words as: double, treble etc. sim. M. 8 , 289 [mUlyAtpaJcaguNo daNDaH] (a fine of five times the value).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. If it is to be said <i>no other than</span>, <i>nobody but</span>, any phrase with the meaning »but for” may be used instead of the abl. Panc. 176 [tvAM muktvAnyo na jJAsyati] (no other but you will know it), ibid. 160 [tvadvarjamanyo bhartA manasyapi me na bhaviSyati] — Then, the ablative may also be used even without [anya], as Kumâras. 6, 44 [yasminnAntakaH kusumAyudhAt] » where there is found no [other] death but the god with the flowery arrows [no other Mâra but Mâra = Kâma].”</p>
    <p>In Patanjali I have met with some instances of a rather pleonastic idiom, the neuter [anyad] with abl. = »but for” put before the ablat., though the adj. [anya] precedes, f. i. Pat. 1, 279 [ko ‘nyo dvitIyaH sahAyo bhavitumarhatyanyadata upasargAt] (what else ought to accompany it, if not this preposition), cp. p. 445, line 2; p. 447, line 4; p. 323, line 6. This adverbial use of [anyad] (cp. Greek <i>ἀλλά</span>, and such phrases as <i>οὐὄὲν ἄλλο…ἀλλ’ἤ</span>) is confirmed by its being named among</p>
    <p>the nipâtâs in the gaṇa [svarAdi] (Kaç. I, p. 17, line 10).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 4. Çak. VII [maghavataH satkriyAvizeSAdanupayupaktamivAtmAnaM samarthaye] (I do not hold myself for deserving the extraordinary honour bestowed upon me by Indra) is an instance of this abl. with the negative [anupayukta] (not fit); the abl. would be impossible here, but for the negation.</p>
