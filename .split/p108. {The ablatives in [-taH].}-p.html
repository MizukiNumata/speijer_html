    <p>108. {The ablatives in [-taH].}</p>
    <p>In the foregoing the ending [taH] has been considered as if it possessed the full worth of the regular case-endings of the ablative. Yet a full and complete identity between them may alone be stated for the pronouns. Pâṇini gives some rules about [-taH] affixed to nouns, which show that its sphere of employment, though mostly coinciding with that of the ablative, is sometimes a different one. {P. 5, 3, 7.}</p>
    <p>lly With [hIyate] and [ruh] it is forbidden to express the »whence” by the forms in [-taH]. Therefore [svargAddhIyate / parvatAdavarohati], not [svargato hIyate], [parvatato ‘varohati]. {P. 5, 4, 45.}</p>
    <p>2ly Excelling or being weak <i>in</span>, blaming <i>on account of</span>, wickedness <i>with respect to</span> is to be denoted by the instrumental, or by [-taH], not by the ablative proper. {P. 5, 4, 46; 47.} — For this reason, in the verse quoted by Pat. I, p. 2 [duSTaH zabdaH svarato varNato vA] (a word, wrong on account of its accent or of its sound), [svarato] and [varNataH] are interchangeable with [svareNa] and [varNena], not with [svarAt] and [varNAt]. Likewise, in Ch. Up. 4, 17, 4 — quoted page 77 of this book — [RktaH / yajuSTaH / sAmataH] are synonymous with the instrum., and the abl. [RcaH / yujuSaH / sAmnaH] would not be allowed.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. It should however be remembered, that this rule does not apply neither to the points of comparison — f. i. [gAmbhIryAtsAgaropamaH] — nor to the ablative of comparison.</p>
    <p>3ly If the ablative is to express the »whence” — except in the case recorded sub. {P. 5, 4, 45.} 1 — [taH] is equivalent with the regular case-endings. The same applies to the abl., depending on the prepos. [prati]. {P. 5, 4, 44.}</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Pāṇini does not give any rule about using the abl. in [taH] with such adverbs and pronouns as [Rte], [vinA], [anya]. Now, ablatives of that kind are certainly not expressing the <i>apâdâna</span>, as they are taught in the third ohapter of the 2nd adhyâya, not in the fourth of the 1st. Accordingly it would not be allowed using [-taH] with them. Yet practice is not wholly consistent therewith, f. i. [A mUlataH] = [A mUlAt]</p>
    <p>4ly In two cases [-taH] is interchangeable with a genitive, but not with an abl. <i>a.</span>) when expressing the standing <i>on one’s side</span> [devA arjunato (or [arjunasya]) ‘bhavan], {P. 5, 4, 48.} <i>b.</span>) if denoting the <i>disease, against which</span> one applies some remedy or cure: [pravAhikAtaH (or [-kAyAH]) kuru] (give something against diarrhoea). {P. 5, 4, 49.}</p>
