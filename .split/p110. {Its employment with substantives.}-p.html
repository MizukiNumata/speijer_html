    <p>110. {Its employment with substantives.}</p>
    <p>I. With <b>substantives</span>, the genitive serves to qualify them, as [rAjJaH puruSaH] (the king’s man), [damayantyAH svayaMvaraH] (the self-choice of Dam.), [zatrorbalam] (the enemy’s strength), [mitrasyAgamanam] (the friend’s arrival), [samudrasya zoSaNam] (the drying up the ocean), [yajJasyAvayavaH] (a part of the sacridce), [yuddhasyAvakAzaH] (the opportunity of fighting). These examples show 1st that the genitive, at least in prose, commonly precedes the substantive, it is depending upon, 2ly that, like in Latin and Greek, the most different <i>logical</span> relations will find their expression by it. When dividing the whole of its dominion by setting up such categories as the <i>possessive</span> gen., the <i>subjective, objective, partitive</span>, that of <i>origin, matter, quantity</span> etc., it must not be overlooked , that these divisions have been made for clearness’ sake and do not affect the unity of the grammatical duty discharged in all these cases by the genitive. For the rest, not rarely the ordinary logical distinctions may fall short of classifying some given genitive, as in the case of [yuddhasyAvakAzaH], or Utt. II, p. 28 [agastyAzramasya panthAH] (the way to the hermitage of A.) etc.</p>
    <p>Concurrent constructions are 1. compounding the gen. with the subst., it qualifies [rAjapuruSaH] = [rAjJaH puruSaH], see <b>214</span>, 2. using instead of the gen. the derived adjective , as [zAtravaM balam] = [zatrorbalam] or [zatrUNAMbalam] etc. Of these substitutions the latter is comparatively rare, when contrasted with the utmost frequency of the former.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The so called <i>appositional</span> or <i>epexegetic</span> genitive is not nsed in Sanskrit. It is said [puSpapuraM nagaram] not as in English »the city of Pushp.” R. 2, 115, 15 [zirasi kRtvA saMnyAsaM pAduke] (Lat. <i>pignus soccorum</span>, the pledge [represented by] the slippers).</p>
