    <p>When pointing out the genitive as the case to put in such substantives as are wanted to qualify other substantives, it is by no means said that no other construction may be used for the same purpose. Verbal nouns often retain the verbal construction. So, if a moving to or from some place is to be expressed, nouns must be construed just as verbs; it is said [purAtpravAsanam], [puraM gamanam] not [purasya]. Cp. Rem. on 41.</p>
    <p>Thus we meet with instrumentals as [viyogo bhavAdRzaiH] »the separation from men as you are,” [kanyayA zokaH] » sorrow on account of a girl;” — ablatives as [patanADayam] »fear of falling;” — datives as [yUpAya dAru] »wood for a stake,” [samayo yaivarAjyAya] »the fit time for being heir-apparent;” — locatives as [viSayeSu saGgaH] » attachment to the world, worldliness;” — prepositions as [mAM prati kopaH] »anger towards me,” [tasyopari pakSapAtaH] »partiality for his sake,” [samaM zaktimatA yuddham] »a contention with a mighty one.”</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Pāṇini has a special rule about the nouns [Izvara] (lord), [svAmin] (owner), [adhipati] (chief), [dAyAda] (heir), [sAkSi] (witness), [pratibhU] (bail) and [prasUta] (born) as agreeing with a locative as well as with a gen. {P. 2, 3, 39.} So [gavAM svAmI] or [goSu]; cp. Kathâs. 18, 144 [tvamasmAkaM svAmI] with ibid. 6, 166 [svAmI viSaye]. So Mrcch. X, p. 384 [pRthivyAM saevavihAreSu kulapatirayaM kriyatAm] (let he be appointed prior of all the monasteries</p>
    <p>of the land).</p>
