    <p>112. {Possessive genitive.}</p>
    <p>The <<b>>possessive genitive</span> has nothing remarkable. As in other languages, it may be the predicate of the sentence. M. 7, 96 [yo yajjayati tasya tat] (what one conquers, is one’s own), ibid. 7, 91 the vanquished warrior surrenders himself with these words [tavAsmi] (I am yours) ; Mhbh. I, 154, 3 [kasya tvam] (»whose are you?” that is »of what family?”); Mudr. III, p. 103 [sthAne khalvasya vRSalo devazcandraguptaHj] (duly, forsooth, the Çudra-king Candragupta is his = is but an instrument in his [Cânakya’s] hand), R, 2, 42, 7 (Daçar. to Kaik) [ye ca tvAmanujIvanti nAhaM teSAM na mama] (and those, who are your attendance, do not belong to me, nor I to them). That it may also denote the <i>party</span>, of which one is an adherent, is stated above (<<b>>108</span>, 4).</p>
