    <p>114. {Subjective genitive.}</p>
    <p>The <b>subjective genitive</span> is interchangeable with the instrumental of the agent (66). {P. 2, 3, 66.} According to Pāṇini, the latter is <i>necessary</span>, if the verbal noun be attended by its subject and its object at the same time. In this manner two genitives are avoided, as [gavAM doho gopena] [not [gopasya]] (the milking of the cows by the cow-herd). We may fairly extend this observation, it seems, to all such instances, as where the subjective genitive would be used together with some other sixth case. R. 3, 6, 23 [viprakAramapAkraSTuM rAkSasairbhavatAmimama] (in order to put and end to the harm caused to you by the râxasas), Mâl. VIII, p. 133 [ekAkino bahubhirabhiyogaH] (*1); Mhbh. 1, 145, 17 [yadA…kAryamasmAkaM bhavaDirupapatsayate] (if there will occur something to do by you for us) [not [kAryamasmAkaM bhavatAm], an accumulation of gen. subj. and commodi];</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Some vârttikas on this sûtra of Pāṇini contest the exactness of it. With some krts the subjective genitive is said to be obligatory, even when being used together with an objective genitive, as [cikIrSA viSNumitrasya kaTasya] (V.’s desire of making a mat). According to some, the gen. of the agent is nowhere forbidden.</p>

    <p>But Mudr. I, p. 49 [na marSayiSyati rAkSasakalatrapracchAdanaM bhavataH], for here nothing impedes using the genitive of the agent, the other being avoided by compounding.</p>
