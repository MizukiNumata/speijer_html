    <p>1. A <i>possessive genitive</span> is put to some verbs of <i>owning</span> and <i>ruling</span>, viz. [prabhU], [Iz], [P. 2, 3, 52], the vedic [rAj]. Comp Greek apxeiv tivoc. — So Rgv. 1, 25, 20 [tvaM vizvasya medhira divazca gmazca rAjasi]; Çat. Br. 5, 1, 5, 4 [ekaH sanbahUnAmISTe]. — M. 5, 2 [kathaM mRtyuH prabhavati vedazAstravidAm] (how is it, that Death has power over such as have mastered the veda and the sciences?), Mâlat. II, p. 38 [prabhavati prAyaH kumArINAM janayitA daivaM ca], cp. ibid. IV, p. 70, 1. 2, Mâlav. V, p. 143. — This construction is rare in classic Sanskrit; [Iz] with a gen. seems to be wholly obsolete.</p>
