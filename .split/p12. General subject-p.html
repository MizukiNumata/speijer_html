    <p>12. General subject.</p>
    <p>A general subject may be expressed by using the passive form, as <skt>ucyate} (it is said), <skt>śrūyate} (it is taught). Likewise by the plural of the 3d pers. of the active as <skt>āhuḥ} (they say, when = it is said; germ. <i>man sagt</span>), <skt>viduḥ} (it is known), <skt>ācakṣate} (it is told). But not seldom also the <b>singular of the 3d pers.</span> of the active is employed in this manner. Panc, II, 34 <skt>kāraṇāni mitratām eti kāraṇād eti} (it is not without, one becomes a friend or a foe). The pronoun omitted is <skt>sa} (= one, germ, <i>man</span>), which is also sometimes added. Panc. 1, 216 <skt>tyājyaṃ na dhairyaṃ vidhure ’pi daive / dhairyāt kadācit sthitim āpnuyāt saḥ} (one must not lose courage even in distress; by courage one may regain one's position in time).</p>
