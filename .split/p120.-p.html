    <p>3. The genitive serves to denote the objects of some p</p>
    <p>verbs: <i>a.</span>) [smR] (to remember), <i>b.</span>) [day] (to have mercy), <i>c.</span>) [anukR] (to imitate), <i>d.</span>) some verbs of <i>longing for</span>. {P. 2, 3, 52.} With all of them, however, the accusative is also available.</p>
    <p>Examples: <i>a.</span>) Mudr. II, p. 71 [hA deva nanda smarati te rAkSasaH prasAdAnAm] (ah, king Nanda, Râxasa is well aware of your marks of kindness), Daç. 60 [smara tasyA haMsakathAyAH]. Compare with those genitives these accus. Malar. III, p. 63 [api smaredasmadabhyarthanAm] (should she perhaps remember our suit?), Çâk. V [smariSyati tvAM na sa bodhito’pi san]. The verb [vismR] (to forget) is construed with acc. (*1)</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) Dâç. 97 [ete bhadramukhAstava dayantAm] (may these dear men show mercy towards you). It is often construed with acc.</p>
    <p><i>c.</span>) The person whose deeds etc. are imitated is generally put in the genitive. Mrcch. VI, p. 222 [bhImasyAnukariSyAmi bAhuH zastraM bhaviSyati], Mâlav. V, p. 141 [nanu kalabhena yUthapateranukRtam] (v. a. the apple falls not far from the tree).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1, Comp. [anuvadate] (to speak after), which is construed similarly by Kâç. on P. 1, 3, 49, and [anuharati] (to take after). Pat. I, 393 [pituranuharati] (he takes after his father).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. According to P. 2, 3, 53 compared to 6, 1, 139 [upaskurute] (to take care of) may admit of a genitive.</p>
    <p><i>d.</span>) Here the acc. is the regular construction, and the gen. but scarcely met with, as M. 2, 162 [amRtasyeva cAkAGgedavamAnasya saevadA] (he must always long for being insulted as if it were ambrosia), Mhbh. 3, 12630 [nAthantaH saevakAmAnAm], Mâlat. V, p. 72 [api bhavAnutkaNThate madayantikAyAH] (do you long for Madayantikâ?) ; R. 3, 47, 30 gen. with [spRhayati].</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Yet Bhatt. 17, 10 it complies with a gen., see Petr. Dict. s. v. p. 1386. So in a prâkrt passage of the Uttararâmacaritra p. 19 [visumaridA ahme mahArAadasarahassa rAmabhadreNa] »Râma has made us forget king Daçaratha.”</p>
