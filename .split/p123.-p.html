    <p>6. Verbs of <i>fulness, repletion, satisfaction</span>, as [pUrayati], [tRp], [tuS] are often construed with a genitive, but more commonly with the instrumental. Cp. Latin <i>vas plenum vini vel vino</span> (*1). Examples of the genit. Suçr. 1, 116, 14 [vaktramApUryate ‘zrUNAm] (the face is bathed with tears), Panc. I, 148 [nAgnistRpyati kASThAnAM nApagAnAM mahodadhiH / nAntakaH sarvabhUtAnAm] (fire gets not satiated of wood, nor the ocean of rivers, nor death of mortal beings).</p>
    <p>NB. But the gen. of the <i>person</span>, towards whom kindness is shown with [puSyati], [tuSTa], [prasIdati] and other similar words is of a different kind (131). Mhbh. 1, 229, 32 [tutoSa tasya muneH] (be became well-disposed to this brahman), Panc. 314 [tuSTastavAham] (I am satisfied with you), R. 1, 33, 13 [tasyAstuSTo ‘bhavadgruH] (*2).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Vedic mantras contain many instances of other similar verbs — as [prI], [mad], [kan] etc. — being construed so. Siecke, p. 44 sq.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. With [tRpyati] the loc. is also available. Daç. 174 [sazeSa evAndhasyatRpyata] (he ate it all).</p>
    <p>7. With several verbs the genitive does the duty of an ablative. See 126.</p>
    <p>8. With several verbs the genitive does the duty of a dative. See 131 , 132.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Both gen. and instrum. seem to be old idioms. Yet it will seem, that the gen. with words of <i>fulness</span> has got out of use nowadays. R. 2, 89, 17 [abhipUrNa] being construed with a gen. — [nArINAmabhipUrNastu kAzcit [sc. [nAvaH]] kAzcittu vAjinAm] — the commentary seems it necessary to explain the idiom : [nArIbhiH pUrNA ityAdyarthaH]. Cp. the similar process in Latin (Quintil. 9, 3, 1).</p>

    <p>So Kathâs. 27, 206 [tuSTo’smi vAm]; the interpunetion in Brockhaus, edition is here wrong.</p>
