    <p>124. {Genitive with adjectives.}</p>
    <p>III. A genitive with adjectives is frequently used. When attending adjectives akin to transitive verbs, it is an objective gen., as Kathâs. 29, 55 [jarA vinAzinyasya tUpasya] (old age, which will destroy this beauty). Among them are to be especially noticed:</p>
    <p>1. Those of <i>knowledge, skill, exverience</span> and the contrary (as [abhijJa], [anabhijJa], [kovid] and [ucita] (<i>wont to</span>). Mudr. I, p. 34 [sAdhu vatsa / abhijJaH khalvasi lokavyavahArANAM] (bravo, my child, you are well acquainted with the practice of the world), R. 1, 20, 24 [saMgrAmANAmakovidaH] (not skilled in battles); — R. 2, 51, 3 [ucito janaH kezAnAm] (people who are accustomed to trouble).</p>
    <p>Examples with others: Mudr. IV, p. 146 [asahA bharasya] (impatient of the burden), Kâm. 3, 22 [hlAdinIM sarvasatvAnAm] (he must speak so as to rejoice all beings).</p>
    <p>NB. With the adjectives of <i>knowledge</span> and <i>skill</span> and</p>
    <p>with some others the locative is also used (142). (*1) {P. 2, 3, 40.}</p>
    <p>2. [Aya] (depending on) and (clinging to). Panc.</p>
    <p>231 [tavAyattaH sa pratIkAraH] (that remedy depends on you), ibid. 277 [yattayAsya saktaM kiJcidgRhItamasti tatsamarpaya] (give up that, which you have taken belonging to him).</p>
    <p>3. [pUrNa] (full) and its compounds. See 123.</p>
    <p>4. Those of <i>likeness</span> and <i>equality</span>. See 61.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Note [dvitIya] with gen., when subst. = »the match, the counterpart” Pat. I, 445 [asya gordvitIyenArthaH] (an other ox is wanted like this), Kathâs. 25, 178 [ahamevAnayAmyasya dvitIyaM nUyurasya te] (I will fetch you myself the match of this foot-ornament).</p>
    <p>5. A great number of adjectives admit of the dative-like genitive, see 129.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>The Kâçikâ errs interpreting this sûtra so as to take [Ayukta] and [kuzala], as if they meant but these two words, though it is evident, that <i>two categories</span> of words are meant by Pāṇini, that of » occupation” ([Ayukta]) and that of »skill” ([kuzala]). The rule given 1, 1, 68 — [svaM rUpaM zabdasyAzabdasaMjJA] — is commonly interpreted in too narrow a sense. It does not purport that any word occurring in Pāṇini’s text, but for a <i>sanjñâ</span>, does signify but the word itself, not its synonyms — if this were so, we should have to enregister its violation every moment — but simply this: with the exception of such algebraical signs, as [vu] = [aka], [Tha] = [eya], [gha] = the suffixes of the grades of</p>
    <p>comparison, sim., the sounds and words of which the vyâkaraṇa-sûtra is made up, are to be understood such as they are uttered. But it is left to the common sense of the reader to infer in each separate case , whether the word contained in the grammatical rule is meant as to its outer shape or as to its meaning, whether it is to denote but one or a whole class of words of the same purport, as [Ayukta] and [kuzala] evidently do here.</p>
    <p>For the rest, the vernacular grammarians themselves are obliged to admit of exceptions on their own interpretation of P. 1, 1, 68. See but the vârtt. on that sûtra.</p>
