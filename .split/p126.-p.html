    <p>On this account we may understand how the genitive is sometimes used instead of the ablative with <i>a.</span>) verbs of <i>asking, wishing, taking, receiving</span> etc., <i>b.</span>) of <i>hearing, learning</span>, <i>c.</span>) of <i>being afraid of</span>.</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) The abl. is here the regular idiom; the gen. not frequent, as Râjat. 1, 131 [rAjJastasya…vRajato vijayezvaraM / yayAce kAcidabalA bhojanam], R. 1, 28, 10 [pratIccha mama] (accept of me), M, 4, 87 [rAjJaH pratigRhNAti lubdhasyocchAstravartinaH] ( — accepts of a king, who is avaricious and a transgressor of his royal duty), Panc. 225 [ahamasya brAhmaNasya goyugamapahariSyAmi]. So already in the archaic dialect. Gaut. 17, 1 [prazastAnAM svakarmasu dvijAtInAM brAhmaNo bhuJcIta pratigRhNoyAJca] (a brahman is allowed to eat and to accept presents from twice-born men of good behaviour) ;</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) R. 6, 31, 2 [cArANAM rAvaNaH zrutvA prAptaM rAmam] (Râvana after having heard from his spies the arrival of Râma), ibid. 3, 3, 4 [nibodha mama] (be informed from me). So sometimes with [zuzrUSate] (cp. 86 c), as R. 2, 100, 7 [kaJcicchuzrUSase pituH]</p>
    <p><i>c.</span>) R. 2, 29, 4 [tava saeve hi bibhyati] (all are afraid of you), Panc. III, 195 [yA mamodvijate nityam] (she, who has always an aversion to me). R. 3, 46, 29-31 affords an instance of <i>both constructions together</span> : [iha zAkhAmRgAH siMhAH…kathaM tebhyo na bibhyase / …kuJcarANAM tarasvitAM kathaM]</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Compare [nirviNNa] (disgusted with) with a gen. Panc. [mUSakamAMsasya nirviNNAham] (I am disgusted with the flesh of mice), cp. 97 , R.</p>
    <p>Now and then this abl.-like genitive seems to have modern been extended beyond its limits by abuse, especially of modern writers (*1). {Spreading of employment with modern writers.}</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>But not exclusively. The older literature does not lack of instances, as R. 3, 51, 27 [baddhastvaM kAlapAzena kva gatastasya [instead of tasmAd] mokSyase]; cp. 3, 66, 11 . — A very striking example is Bhâg. Pur. 8, 6, 21 [amRtotpAdane yatnaH kriyatAmavilambitam / yasya pItasya vai janturmRtyugrasto], here the gen. is abusively employed instead of the abl. [yasmAtpItAt]. M. De Saussure, from whose valuable treatise <i>de l’emploi du génitif absolu en Sanscrit</span> I borrow this example (see his note on p. 10), proves the impossibility of accounting for that gen. in a satisfactory way, when starting from the absolute construction. Hereby it is however not said that the presence of the participle [pIta] has not moved the author of the Bhagâvata to employ the genitive instead of the ablative. Likewise I scarcely believe Kalhaṇa would have used a gen. with [yAc] (Râjat. 1, 131, see 126 a), if the noun were not attended by a participle. Similarly with [zru] the gen. is preferred, if it be wanted to express the <i>hearing somebody say</span> or <i>utter something</span>, as Mhbh. 1, 141, 18 [zRNu vadato mama]. In short, it is likely, that the relative frequency of genitives of participles in Sanskrit style, especially if compared to the rareness of similar ablatives, has favorized the spreading of the ablative-like genitive.</p>
    <p>It may also be noticed, that in most of such cases pronouns are concerned.</p>
