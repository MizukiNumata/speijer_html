    <p>Note the genitive being used in some turns of phrase, which might be put as well in the category of the ablative as in that of the genitive.</p>
    <p>1° a gen, with verbs of <i>speaking</span> etc. to denote him, <i>about whom</span> something is said, as Panc. 82 [mamAdoSasyApyevaM vadati] (so he speaks of me, who am however guiltless (*1).</p>
    <p>2° with [saMbhAvayati] and the like = »to expect <i>of</span>, to suppose <i>of</span>.” Mrcch. IX, p. 297 [sarvamasya mUrlhasya saMbhAvyati] (that blockhead is capable to everything), Panc. 34 [na tAdRkapuruSANAmevaMvidhaM ceSTitaM saMbhAvyati] (of such men one must not suppose such conduct). But the locative is here also available.</p>
    <p>3° with [kSam] (to forbear of) etc. R. 1, 15, 7 [sarvaM tasya kSamAmahe], Pat. I, p. 40 [etadekamAcAryasya…mRSyatAm]. — When without object, the gen. with may be considered a dative-like one, as Mhbh. 1, 79, 9 [ziSyasyAziSyavRttestu na kSantavyaM bubhUSatA] (a man who wishes his wellbeing should not forbear a scholar, who does not behave as such).</p>
