    <p>129. {Dative-like genitive or <i>genitivus commodi et incommodi</span>.}</p>
    <p>V. The genitive serves also to denote him, who is concerned by the action or fact, the so-called <i>remote object.</span></p>
    <p>This kind of genitive, as it stands on the same ground as the dative, I name <b>dative-like genitive</span>. Partly it may be substituted to the dative, but in a great number of cases the dative would even be unavailable, at least in classic Sanskrit, especially, if the person concerned is to be expressed <i>in such sentences, as where the predicate is nominal (substantive or adjective)</span>. In such turns as Kathâs. 29, 98 [ihAmutra ca sAdhvInAM patirekA gatiH] (for virtuous wives the only path to follow here and hereafter is their husband), Panc. II, 58 [ko’tibhAraH samarthAnAM kiM krUraM vyavasAyinAm / ko videzaH savidyAnAM kaH paraH priyavAdinAm] (what is too heavy for the vigorous? what danger does exist for the audacious? what is a foreign country for the learned? who is unattainable for the flatterer?) the genitive is the regular idiom, and the dative out of use. Likewise the genitive — not the dative — is to be employed, with adjectives of <i>friendship</span> and <i>enmity</span>, <i>fitness</span> and <i>unfitness</span>, <i>good</span> and <i>evil</span> etc., as Panc. 331 [asya matsyAmiSaM sadA priyam] (a fish-dinner is always welcome to him), ibid. 213 [na yuktaM bhavataH] (it does not suit you).</p>
    <p>Examples : Kumâr. 3, 10 [ke mama dhanvino ‘nye] (who are other archers to me?), Mrcch. VIll p. 246 [(madanaH) satpuruSasya…bhavati mRdurnaiva vA bhavati] (the God of Love is either mild for an honest man or he does not exist for him), Mhbh. 1, 141, 36 [avijJAtA bhavaSyAmo lokasya] (we shall be unknown to the people), Panc. 200 [yathArthavAdino dRtasya na doSaH karaNIyaH] (one must not take it ill of a messenger, if he speaks plain), Çâk. IV [bharturviprakRtApi roSaNatayA mAsma pratIpaM gamaH] (do not oppose your husband by anger, even when offended).</p>

    <p>{With adjectives, as [priya] etc.}</p>
    <p>Among the adjectives, which comply with a gen., note such as [anurUpa], [anukUla] and [pratikUla], [priya] and [vipriya], [yogya], [yukta] — and even the verb [yujyate] (to suit) — and their synonyms. So Nala 1, 19 [kariSyAmi tava priyam], Panc. III, 104 [AtmanaH pratikUlAni pareSAM na samAcaret] (one should not do to others, what is grievous to one’s self), Mrcch. I, p. 58 [ayogyamidaM nyAsasya gRham] (this house is not fit for a deposit), ibid. X, p. 355 [na yujyate tava prANaparityAgaH], Mâlav. IV, p. 96 [zItakriyA cAsyA rujaH prazistA] (and cold is excellent against this ailment), Mhbh. 1, 15, 4 [samaH sarvasya lokasya] (the same to all beings), Mâlav, IV, p. 88 [ka evaM vimukho ‘smAkam] (who is so disinclined to me?), ibid. III, p, 75 [payaptimetAvatA kAminAm] (so much suffices for persons in love).</p>
    <p>So [sadRza] and [ucita], when = »becoming to, suiting.” R. 2, 30, 41 [saevathA sadRzaM sIte mama svasya kulasya ca / vyavasAyamanukrAntA kAnte tvamatizobhanam]; Çâk. I [ucitamevaitatpuruvaMzaprabhavanarendrapradIpasya]. As to [arha] and [anarha] cp. the foot-note on p. 40 of this book. Note also [anagha], [anRNa] etc. with a gen. = »guiltless towards”, as R. 2, 49, 7 [prajAnAmanagha], M, 9, 106 [pitRRNAmanRNaH] (having paid his debts to the <i>pitaras</span>).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Pāṇini teaches, that with participles in [-ta] the genitive must be used, and not the instrum. of the agent, if the participle is employed as a present one. {P. 2, 3, 67.} Such genitives as [rAjJAM mataH] (approved by the kings), [rAJAM pUjitaH] (honored by the kings) fall within the limits of this rule. See Mhbh. 1, 141, 36 and Çâk. IV quoted above, and cp. Çâk. II [vidito bhavAnAzramasadAmihasthaH] (your staying here is known to the hermits).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. On the genit. with krtyâs see 66 R, According to P. 2, 3, 69 the genitive is forbidden with the krts [khalarthe], that is such as [sulabha], [IStkara] (cp. P. 3, 3, 126 sq.). Kâç.. gives as examples [ISadkaro] (the mat is scarcely to be made by you), [ISatpAnaH somo bhavatA]. So R. 3, 5, 23 [karma hyanena kartavyaM mahadanyaiH suduSkaram]. In fact, however, [sukara], [duSkara], [sulabha], [durlabha] are often construed with the genitive. Dâç. 72 [dvitIyastu sarvasyaiva sulabhaH], R. 2, 97, 7 [neyaM mahI durlabhA], Kathâs. 24, 65 [kiM nAma kitavasya hi duSkaram].</p>

    <p>This idiom extends also to <i>adjectives</span>, <i>used as participles</span>. Utt. III, [devyA zUnyasya jagato dvAdazaH parivatsaraH] (it is now the twelfth year, that the world is destitute of its queen).</p>
