    <p>131. {Dat.-like genitive with verbs.}</p>
    <p>The dative-like genitive attends even on verbs. Mrcch. X, p. 875 [kimasya pApasyAnuSThIyatAm] (what is to be done to this wicked man?) and ibid. X, p. 384 [kimasya bhikSoH kriyatAm] (what is to be done for this monk?) are striking examples of the sixth case used so. It is especially verbs of <i>doing good or evil</span> (as [upakR], [prasad], [apakR], [aparAdh]), [vizvas] (to trust), [kSam] (to forbear) and some others which partake of this idiom, its concurrent construction being the locative, rarely, if at all, the dative (*1).</p>
    <p>Examples: R. Gorr. 4, 38, 47 [mitrANAmupakurvaNo rAjyaM rakSitumarhasi] (you must guard your kingdom by doing well to your friends), ibid, 3, 1, 16 [rAmasya satkRtya] (offered hospitality to R.), Panc. 289 [kiM mayA tasyAstavApi cApakRtam] (in what have I injured her or youf ), Çâk. VII [aparAddho ‘smi tatrabhavataH kaNvasya] (I have sinned against the reverend Kanva), Panc. 38 [sa na kasyacidvizvasiti] (he trusts nobody), Mhbh. 1, 23, 26 [prasIda naH prayAcatAm] (be merciful to us, who beseech thee), Mâlat, VII, p. 126 [vAyuryUnAmabhinavavadhUsaMnidhAnaM vyanakti] (the wind declares to the young men the nearness of young women).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In Latin, with such turns as <i>adimo vestem servo</span> or <i>servi, civium</span> or <i>civibus dolor auctus est</span>, the dative and the genitive are both available. Sanskrit invariably uses the genitive. Panc. II, 141 [udyamena hi sidhyanti kAryANi na manorathaiH / na hi siMhasya suptasya pravizanti mukhe mRgAH] (it is by exertion, that enterprises are successful, not by wishing, deer do not enter the mouth of a sleeping lion), ibid. p. 145 [hiraNyako’pi mantharakasya praNAmaM kRtvA] (H. made his reverence to M.), ibid. 137 [mama mahatI prItiH saMjAtA] (I have got great pleasure).</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>As to [aparAdh], [upakR], [apakR], [vizvas], I do not remember having met with any instance of their agreeing with a dative; [kSam] governs a dative Bhaṭṭ. 4, 39. Upon the whole, the dative of profit and damage within its narrower limits is very scarce in Sanskrit, cp. 84.</p>
