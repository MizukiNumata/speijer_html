    <p>132. {Genitive of the remote object.}</p>
    <p>Finally, the genitive <i>is allowed</span> to attend all verbs, as are commonly construed with the dative of concern. Such a genitive may be not without affectation (*1), it is object of frequent occurrence in literature (*2). So it is found with 1. verbs of <i>giving</span>, <i>offering</span>, 2. of <i>telling</span>, <i>speaking</span>, 3. of <i>carrying</span>, <i>sending</span>, 4. of <i>showing</span>, 5. of <i>enjoining</span>, 6. of <i>promising</span>, 7. of <i>pleasing</span>, 8. of <i>being angry</span>, 9. of <i>bowing</span>, <i>prostrating one’s self</span>, etc.</p>

    <p>So at least is the opinion of Anandoram Borooah (§212 of his »<i>Higher Sanskrit Grammar</span>”) —and his opinion may be considered to hold good nowadays in India with Sanskrit-writing people — »the gen. is also occasionally used for the Dat. or Indirect Object, especially by pedantic writers” and »it will be seen from the above examples that such use besides being pedantic, is very ambiguous.” The ambiguity, however, cannot be very great, for as a rule the context will show us how to accept such genitives, and in such cases, as where the context would not enable us to understand him plainly, a good writer will avoid <i>all</span> ambiguous constructions. That the dative-like genitive has been known and employed in India of old — though not to the extent, it has got in the classic dialect — may be seen from some of the examples quoted above. As with other concurrent idioms, there is many an instance of both cases used together, as R. 2, 34, 6 [dvAri tiSThati te sutaH / brAhmaNebhyo dhanaM dattvA saevaM caivopajIvinAm], schol. [upajIvinAM ca tebhyazca dattvA]. In the comment of Kâç. on P. 3, 3, 111 the printed text has [RNAM yatparasya dhAryate], the other reading [parasmai] is mentioned in a</p>
    <p>foot-note.</p>

    <p>In the vulgar dialects the dative has got obsolete, and the genitive has been substituted to it, the few traces of a dative in Prâkrit literature being owed to the artificial language of dramatic poetry. See Lassen Inst, linguae pracriticae, p. 299, Vararuci <i>Prâkṛtaprakâça</span> 6, 64.</p>
    <p>Kuhn <i>Beiträge zur Pali Grammatik</span>, p. 70 sq. gives an account of the remnants of the dative in Pali, which are more considerable, than in the other präkṛts, and contain both infinitives in <i>-tave</span> and datives in <i>-âya</span>, especially <i>atthâya</span> = skṛt <i>arthâya</span>; as a rule, the pali dative serves to denote the <i>purpose</span>. The same process has been at work in Modern Greek. Schinas, <i>Grammaire élémentaire du grec moderne</span>, Paris, 1829 p. 90: »le génitif sert de régime indirect aux verbes et remplace le datif: <i>ὃῶσε μουψμι</span> donne-moi du pain, <i>λέγω τοῦ χριτοῦ τὴν ἀλήθειαν</span> je dis aujnge la vérité.”</p>
