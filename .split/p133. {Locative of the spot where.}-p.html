    <p>133. {Locative of the spot where.}</p>
    <p>The seventh case or locative serves to signify the tive of scene of the action. Its power is expressed by English prepositions, as <i>in, on, at, among, with, by, near</span>. It has not only the duty of pointing out the spot where, but also the spot whither. In other terms, sometimes it answers Lat. <i>in</span> with abl., sometimes <i>in</span> with accus.</p>
    <p>A. <i>Locative of the spot where</span>. — Here we must make the following distinctions.</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) the locative conveys the notion of being <i>within, in</span>. M. 1, 9 [tasmiJcajJe] (in this [egg] Brahman himself was born), Daç. 156 [gaGgAmbhasi viharan] (sporting in the water of the Ganges), ibid. 179 [kasyaciccitrakarasya haste citrapaTaM dadarza].</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) it denotes a surface, trodden or touched: <i>on, upon, over, at</span>. Panc. 307 [rAsabhaH kazcittatra zmazAne dRSTaH] (an ass was seen on that cemetery), R. 3, 5, 10 [vyajane) gRhIte vAranArIbhyAM dhUyamAne ca mUrdhani] (courtesans, holding fans, waved them over his head), Panc. 331 [te ca matsyA vahnau pAcanAya tiSThanti] (and those fishes are being boiled over the fire), Daç. 140 [pitA me viviktAyAM bhUmau sthito’bhUt] (my father laid down on the naked earth), ibid. 141 [zirasi jaghrantI].</p>
    <p><i>c.</span>) it signifies the dominion or territory: <i>in, at, on,</span> Latin <i>apud, in</span>. Panc, l [asti dAkSiNAtye janapade mahilAropyaM nAma nagaram], ibid. 319 [rAjagRhe meSayUthamasti] (in the royal palace there was a flock of rams), Kumâras. 5, 60 [phalaM dRSTaM drumeSu] (fruits are seen on the trees). So [paJcAleSu] (in the country of the Pancâlâs), [kAzyAm] (at Benares), Mhbh. 1, 31, 18 [ayamindrastribhuvane] (he has been made Lord over the three worlds); cp, 111 R.</p>
    <p><i>d.</span>) it indicates something very near, though not directly touched: <i>near, on, about</span> (*1). Mhbh. 1, 170, 3 [AsedurgaGgAyAM pANDunandanAH] (Pâṇḍu's sons pitched tents near the Ganges), Hitop. 29 [no cedanAhAreNAtmAnaM tava dvAri vyApAdayiSyAmi] (otherwise I will kill myself by starvation at your door). So Kâd. I, p. 39 [yatra] is used, while meaning aabout which spot.”</p>
    <p><i>e.</span>) it is expressive of <i>among, amid</span>. Nala 1, 13 [na deveSu na yakSeSu tAdRgrUpavatI kvacit / mAnuSeSvapi cAnyeSu dRSTapUrvAtha vA zrutA] (neither among devas nor yakshas nor men nor among other beings such a beauty has been seen nor heard of anywhere), Daç. 124 [abhramacca paurajAnapadeSviyaM vArttA] (this report spread among the townsmen and the countrymen). Cp. 116.</p>
    <p>All these variegations are mixed up in the general notion, carried by the seventh case. Greater precision, if wanted, may be obtained by using periphrasing turns, as the prepos. [antaH] (within), or such words as [madhye], [tale], [pRSThe], [ekadeze], [saMnidhau], etc. See 165, 190, 192.</p>
