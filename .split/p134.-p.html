    <p>The spot reached may also be denoted by the <i>accusative</span>. Compare with the above examples these: Ch. Up. 5, 3, 1 [samitimeyAya] (he came at the meeting), Panc. 143 [svapRSThamAropya] (after having put me on your back), Çâk. I [tapovanaM tAvatpravizAmi] etc. etc.</p>
    <p>So with verbs of <i>going, bringing, carrying, sending, ascending, entering</span>. Those, however, of <i>falling, throwing, placing, putting</span> — as [pat], [kSip], [nyas], [nivezayati], [sthApayati] — seem to be construed with the locative exclusively. On the other hand the accusative is obligatory, if „to come to” is the metaphorical expression of „to become” (236), and in some other standing turns, as [tulAmArohati].</p>
