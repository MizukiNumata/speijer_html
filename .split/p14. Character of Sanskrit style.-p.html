    <p>14. Character of Sanskrit style.</p>
    <p>1STly. Sanskrit, in comparison with western languages does not avail itself much of finite verbs. Hence abundance of gerunds, participles, absolute locatives, noun-predicates and a relative scarcity of subordinate sentences. Accumulating short coordinate phrases is likewise avoided by using gerunds. Daçak. 19 <skt>bālaṃ śanair avaniruhādavatārya vanāntare vanitām anviṣyā ’vilokyainam ānīya gurave nivedya tan nirdeśena bhavadantikam ānītavān asmi} = »I took off the baby from the tree and sought for the fair one in the forest, but not discovering her I carried it to ray teacher, and gave it over in his hands. By his order I now have brought the boy to you.”</p>
    <p>In Sanskrit style the predicate of the sentence is many times expressed by means of a <i>nomen actionis</span>, to be translated by a finite verb. Panc. 21 <skt>damanaka āha / svāmin kimiha nivṛtyāvasthānam} (Dam. said: why does my master stop and stay here?)</p>
    <p>2NDly. Abstracts in <skt>-tā} or <skt>-tva} may be made of any noun either simple or compound. Since they are available in all noun-cases, they afford an easy expedient to bring a whole clause into a shape as concise as possible and to express logical relations in the very sharpest and most distinct way. Hence they are often employed in treatises, commentaries and similar works. A more detailed account of them will be given hereafter.</p>
    <p>3RDly. A great and important place in Sanskrit composition is filled up by compound nouns. This synthetic expression of thought is applied to the most various and manifold logical relations, but it is especially in the more flowery style of adorned literary composition, that they are used at a considerably large extent. Relative clauses are commonly avoided by them.</p>
    <p>4THly. An other characteristic of Sanskrit style is its predilection for the <i>oratio directa</span>. Words and thoughts are related just as they have been spoken and thought or supposed to have been, but they are not moulded into the figure of an <i>oratio obliqua</span>. Generally the adverb <skt>iti} (thus, so) is put behind the words or thoughts related. Accordingly the English sentence <i>he asked his friend, why he had not left this town</span> is Sanskrit <skt>kasmād asmān nagarān na prasthitosīti mitram apṛcchat}. So f. inst. Utt. I <skt>pariśrānteyamāryā tadvijñāpayāmi viśrāmyatāmiti} (Mylady is tired; for this reason I beg Her to take Her rest).</p>
    <p>5THly. The system of correlation between relatives and demonstratives, though sufficiently developed as to the number and variety of combinations, has retained a great deal of the unwieldiness and prolixity of its rudimentary stage. It often reminds of the solemn style of old Latin. Mostly the relative clause precedes. Panc. 2 <skt>yathā mama manorathāḥ siddhaṃ yānti tathānuṣṭhoyatām} (act so as to fulfill my wishes), ibid. 70 <skt>yaḥ kūpo dṛṣṭo 'bhūttameva kūpamāsādya}, and the like.</p>
    <p>6THly. Sanskrit likes rhetorical interrogations, that is, such as do not put a question, but contain a statement either positive or negative. As this turn is much more employed than in modern languages, such interrogations are often to be translated rather freely. So <skt>kaḥ} is not rarely an other expression of »nobody” and <skt>ko na} = »every body;” <skt>kutaḥ} is frequently = »because.” Similarly <skt>atha kim} = »yes,” <skt>katham} and <skt>nanu} = »certainly,” cp. the idiom <skt>kva ca…kva ca} and other turns, more fully to be dealt with in one of the subsequent chapters. Compare Engl. <i>why</span>, when = »now, well,&quot; Greek οὐχοὖν.</p>
    <p>7THly. The predilection for the passive construction has been already mentioned (see 7). It is of course not restricted to the finite verb, but applies also to participles.</p>
