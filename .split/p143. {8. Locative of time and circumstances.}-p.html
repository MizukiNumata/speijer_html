    <p>143. {8. Locative of time and circumstances.}</p>
    <p>8. The locative, which denotes the circumstances, <i>under which</span> the action comes to pass So [Apadi] „in time of distress”, [kAle] „in due time,” [bhAgyeSu] „in fortune” and the like. This kind of locative has a very great extension and encompasses also the <<b>>locative of time</span> as well as the absolute locative. The former denotes the time <i>at</span> which, the <i>when</span>, as [dinedine] (every day), [varSAsu] (in the rainy season), [nizAyAm] (at night), [pratyUSe] (at daybreak), [eSu vAsareSu] (in these days), (at the beginning) etc. Ch. Up, 3, 16, 2 [etasminvayasi] (in this age).</p>
    <p>The latter occurs, if the <i>circumstance under which</span> is signified by two nouns, one of which is the predicate of the other. As the said noun-predicate generally is expressed by a participle, it is to the chapter on participles we refer for a full account of the absolute locative. Here it may suffice to point out by an evident example its close connexion with the locatives of circumstance and time.</p>

    <p>thus freely translated by Wilson: »But let Your Highness weigh / <i>these circumstances</span> also…your forces are collected, / yourself, the heir legitimate of kings, / your adversary but a base usurper; / his very capital is hostile him, / in me you have a faithful guide at least; / and all appliances and means to boot / provided; nought remains but your command” (*1).</p>

    <p>Compare such locatives, which denote a circumstance by a single word, as in the proverb [chidreSvanarthA bahulIbhavanti] (v. a. misfortune never comes singly), Panc. V, 103 [naikaH supteSu jAgRyAt]. They cannot be styled absolute locatives, but serve just the same purpose as those.</p>
