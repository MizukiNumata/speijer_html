    <p>145. {Dative-like locative.}</p>
    <p>III. <b>Dative-like locative</span>. In 134 it has been shown, that the locative is used with verbs of <i>putting in</span> or <i>on</span>, <i>placing</span> etc. Sanskrit extends that idiom to many kindred conceptions, and often uses the locative with verbs of <i>giving</span>, <i>promising</span>, <i>buying</span>, <i>selling</span>, <i>telling</span> etc., so as to make it concur with the dative or the genitive of the remote object. Cp. English <i>to bestow upon</span>.</p>
