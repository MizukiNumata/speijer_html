    <p>147. {<i>Nimittasaptamî</span>.}</p>
    <p>IV. <b>Nimittasaptamî</span>. As the locative often denotes the spot, towards which there is some movement, so it may be used at a very large extent to signify the person or thing, <i>towards which</span> some action is directed, in other terms, that <i>on account of which</span> something is done. Speaking exactly, the dative-like locative, we have dealt with in the last two paragraphs, is but a consequence of this general faculty to denote that, about which one is engaged. Here are some examples of this idiom : Kâç. on P. 2, 3, 36 [carmaNi dvIpinaM hanti dantayorhanti kuJcaraM / kezeSu camarI hanti sImni puSkalako hataH] (the panter is killed on account of its skin, the elephant for its tusks, yaks for their tails and the musk-deer on account of its musk-gland), Kâç. on P. 1, 3, 47 [kSetre vivadante] (they are at law on account of a field), Panc. 288 [yuktamidaM svAmino nijabhRtyeSu] (this is oonTenient for a lord with respect to his attendants), M. 3, 107 [uttameSUttamaM kuryAddhIne hInaM same samam].</p>
