    <p>This kind of locative is sometimes bordering on that, taught in 140.</p>
    <p>The <i>nimittasaptamî</span> (locative of the motive; locative of reference) often serves to qualify such substantives as [sauhada], [bhakti], [vaira], [abhilASa], [Adara], [anAdara], [anukroza], [avajJA], [kRpA], [vizvAsa] and the like. The genitive is here, of course, the concurrent construction.</p>
