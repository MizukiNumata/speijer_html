<p>15. Order of words.</p>
<p>Like all languages, that possess a rich store of inflections, Sanskrit affords a comparatively great freedom as to the order of words in the sentence (*1). Yet, it is frequently not altogether indifferent in what order one puts one's words. We ought to distinguish between the traditional or regular arrangement and the various exceptions caused by the exigencies of style, euphony, metre etc. Therefore though tracing a general scheme, we must keep in mind, that it bears but on the most frequent employment, as it has been observed in perusing the best writers, but it cannot claim to be a set of fixed rules rigorously to be followed throughout.</p>
