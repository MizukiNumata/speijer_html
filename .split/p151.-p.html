    <p>The apparatus for periphrasing case-relations may be classed into three main categories, viz. 1. prepositions, 2. noun-cases, 3. verbal forms. The boundary between the first class and the second is in some degree unsettled and floating; of the noun-cases concerned here a great deal, indeed — viz. such words as [antareNa], [samam], [Rte], [prabhRti], those in [-taH] etc. — are construed in the same way as the old and genuine prepositions, whereas others are always felt as nouns and construed accordingly — of the kind are [nimittena], [balAt], [vazAt], [hetoH], [dvAreNa], [madhye] etc.</p>
    <p>The third class is made up of gerunds — as [Arabhya], [AdAya], [uddizya], [AsthAya], [muktvA], [adhikRtya], etc. — or participles in [-ta] — viz. [yukta], [sahita], [rahita], [hIna]. [gata] and the like.</p>
