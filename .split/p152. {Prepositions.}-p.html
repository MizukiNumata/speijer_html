    <p>152. {Prepositions.}</p>
    <p>Sanskrit prepositions should rather be styled ,,post-positions,‚Äù as they are generally put behind the nouns, they are construed with, [A] being the one, that is always put before. As a rule, they are also allowed to be compounded with their nouns; in that case, the preposition is generally the former member(*1).</p>

    <p>It is wrong to say that the noun-case, attending on the prepos., is <i>governed</span> by it, for it is not the preposition, that causes the case, but it is the general bearing of the case, which is qualified and limited by the preposition,</p>
