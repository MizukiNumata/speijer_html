    <p>158. [abhi] and [pari].</p>
    <p>7. [abhi] and 13. [pari], both <i>with acc.</span>, are almost synonymous, cp. Greek <i>ἀμφί</span> and <i>περί</span>.</p>
    <p>They had of old the meaning ,round, about,” when in metaphorical sense, also »concerning, on.” In literature examples of [pari] are extremely rare, if they occur at all; it seems to have soon antiquated. Instances of [abhi] are met with, especially in the archaic dialect. Kâç.9. on P. 2, 1, 14 [agnimabhi] — or [abhyagni] [compound adverb] — [zalabhAH patanti] (the fire-flies hover round the fire); Ch. Up. 4, 6, 1 [abhi sAyam] (about the evening); Kaṭh. 1, 10 [vItamanyurgautamo mAmabhi] (G. feels no anger against me).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Pâṇini (1, 4, 90) (*1) teaches a fourfold employment of [pariH] <i>a.</span>) it denotes a mark, <i>b.</span>) it expresses a quality, <i>c.</span>) it signifies that which falls to one’s share, <i>d.</span>) it is used in a distributive sense. The same is stated for [anu] and [prati]; also for [abhi], save that it cannot be karmapravacanîya in the ease <i>c.</span>). The Kâçikâ illustrates this rule by these examples: <i>a.</span>) [kRkSaM pari] - or [prati] or [anu] or [abhi] - [vadyotate vadyut] »the lightning flashes round the tree;” <i>b.</span>) [sAdhurdevadatto mAtaramabhi] - or [anu] or [prati] or [pari] - »N.N. is good for his mother;” <i>d.</span>) [kRkSaMvRkSamabhi -] or [anu] or [prati] or [pari] - [siJcati] »he waters one tree after another,” (*2) whereas <i>c.</span>) [yadatra mAM pari] - or [prati] or [anu] - [syAttad doyatAm] »give me whatever be my share of it,” but [yadatra mAmabhiSyAt], here [abhi] is upasarga not karmapravacanîya.</p>
    <p>In the dialect of tha vaidik mantras, I indeed, both [abhi] and [pari] display this large sphere of employment, almost the same as that of [prati] in classic Sanskrit, see 179. With [abhi] cp. the like use of Greek <i>ἀμφί</span>, Germ. <i>um</span>, Dutch <i>om</span>.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. To the obsolete [abhi] and [pari] classic Sanskrit has substituted their derivatives [abhitaH] and [paritaH], which however are only used of space. See 186.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 8. An <i>ablative</span> is taught with [pari], when = [apa] (167), Then the prepos. should be put twice: [pari pari trigartebhyo vRSTo devaH]. {P. 2, 3, 10.} In literature, however, [pari] with abl. is as little met with as [apa], except the vaidik mantras, but there it has a larger employment, being = Lat. <i>ex</span> or ab. {P. 8, 1, 5.}</p>

    <p>When used iu a distributive sense, [anu], [abhi], [pari] are rather to be considered adverbs; [kRkSaM vRkSamanu saJcati] is literally = »he waters tree tree successively,” similarly [-pari] or [-abhi siJcati] he waters tree tree roundabout.” Cp. such passages as R. 3, 47, 10 [ayAcatArthairanvarthaiH] »he entreated [her] by [offering her] grants after grants” lit. grants grants successively.</p>
