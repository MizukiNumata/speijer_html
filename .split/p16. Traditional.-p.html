    <p>16. Traditional.</p>
    <p>The traditional <b>order of words</span> is this. (*1)</p>
    <p>1. The predicate being verbal, it ordinarily closes the sentence, which is headed by the noun-subject, when expressed. The other elements of the sentence are taken in the midst, but placed so as to make the verb have its object immediately before it, <skt>devadattaḥ kaṭhaṃ karoti} (N. N. makes a mat), <skt>devadatto bhrātṛbhiḥ saha pāṭaliputraṃ prasthitiḥ} (N. N. has parted for Pâtaliputra with his brothers). In a similar manner the attributes and other accessories of nouns precede them. Moreover, as one is inclined in Sanskrit to avoid subordinate sentences by availing one's self largely of participles, gerunds and the like (14, I), it often occurs, that the chief sentence is preceded by a greater or smaller amount of accessory elements of the kind, put according to the exigencies of grammar and style either before the subject or subsequent to it. This sentence, taken from Patanjali (I, p. 39, 10) may illustrate the above statement, <skt>pramāṇabhūtaḥ ācāryaḥ darbhapavitrapāṇiḥ śucau avakāśe prāṅmukhaḥ upaviśya mahatā yatnena sūtram praṇayati sma}<i>. </span>Here the subject preceded by its attribute stands at the head, then follows <skt>darbhapavitrapāṇiḥ} formally a predicative attribute of the subject, but as to its meaning an accessory of the gerund <skt>upaviśya}, 3ly the other accessories of the said gerund, 4ly the gerund itself, 5ly the accessories of the chief predicate, finally that predicate itself.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In passive sentences the agent, as far as I have observed, seems to have the precedence in the traditional order of words, not the nominative of the karma. Panc. 126 <skt>tairvipraiḥ sarvavastūni vikrīya bahumūlyāni ratnāni krītāni}, Hitop. 92 <skt>tair vānarair vṛkṣam āruhya sarve nīḍā bhagnāḥ}</p>
    <p>2. If the predicate be a noun, it is put before the subject. Panc. 38 <skt>asāraḥ saṃsāro'yaṃ girinadīvegopamaṃ yauvanaṃ tṛṇāgnisamaṃ jīvitaṃ śaradabhracchāyāsadṛśā bhogāḥ svapnasadṛśo mitraputrakalatrabhṛtyavargasambandhaḥ}. Similarly in the passive. Hit. 20 <skt>adhunā tavānucareṇa mayā sarvathā bhavitavyam} (now at all events I must be your companion).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Pronouns, it seems, may be put indiscriminately before or behind their noun-predicate: <skt>samarthe ’haṃ} or <skt>ahaṃ samarthaḥ}</p>
    <p>3. Attributes are put before their nouns. But when doing duty of a so called predicative attribute, they generally follow. Comp. for inst. the proverb <skt>svayamupagatāśristyajyamānā śapati} (fortune which has arrived spontaneously, grows a curse, when neglected).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Not seldom they are separated from the noun (or pronoun) they belong to. Daç. 141 <skt>mayāsi jātamātraḥ pāpayā parityaktaḥ}; when translating this sentence one should render <skt>pāpayā} by the adverb <i>basely</i> or <i>in a base manner</span>. So Panc. 73 <skt>tad drohabuddherapi mayāsya na viruddhamācaraṇīyam}; note the disjunction of <skt>drohabuddheḥ} and <skt>asya}.</p>
    <p>4. The vocative generally heads the sentence.</p>
    <p>5. The prepositions are commonly preceded by their cases.</p>
    <p>6. In sentences linked to the preceding by means of relatives or particles, these words are put first; when enclitical, they are affixed to the first word of the clause</p>
    <p>they introduce.</p>

    <p>On this subject we have an excellent treatise of Prof. Delbrück. <i>Die altindische Wortfolge aus dem Çatapathabrâhmaṇa</span> 1878. Yet, of course, it does not go beyond the archaic period of Sanskrit literature.</p>
