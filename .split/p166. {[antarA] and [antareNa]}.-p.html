    <p>166. {[antarA] and [antareNa]}.</p>
    <p>Kindred forms of [antaH] are the participles [antarA] and [antareNa], petrified instrumentals. Both agree <i>with the accusative</span>. They are 1st = ,,between,” 2ly = ,,without,” 3ly = ,,save, but for;” 4ly [antareNa] may signify ,,with respect to , concerning.” — Like [antaH], they are allowed to make up a compound with their noun, then the noun is the former member.</p>
    <p>Examples: of 1. — Çâk. III [yAvadviTapAntareNAvalokayAmi] (meanwhile I will look <i>between</span> [= <i>through</span>] the foliage). When construed with two nouns, the prepos. precedes, and [ca] is put twice. Pat. I, 45 [antarA tvAM va mAM ca kamaNDaluH] (the pitcher is <i>between</span> you and me), Çat. Br. 1, 1 , 1, 1 [antareNAhavanIyaM ca gArhapatyaM ca](*1);</p>
    <p>— 2 . Pat. I, 8 [antareNApi mantramagniH kapAlAni saMtApayati] (even <i>without</span> the uttering of mantras fire heats the plates), R. 2, 11, 18 [tatra tvAM cyAvayacchatrustava jIvitamantarA] (there the enemy threw thee down lifeless);</p>
    <p>— 3. Panc. 60 [nUnaM sa lubdho nopAyamantareNa vadhyaH syAt] (I am sure that voracious beast cannot be killed <i>but</span> by a stratagem), R. 3, 19, 7 [nahi pazyAmyahaM loke yaH kuryAnmama vipriyam / antareNa…mahendram] (none but Mahendra);</p>
    <p>— 4. Çâk. V. [tadasyA devIM vasumatImantareNa mahadupAlambhanaM gato’smi] (therefore I have incurred a heavy reproof from her <i>with respect to</span> queen Vasumatî) (*2).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Occasionally a genitive is found instead of the acc. with [antareNa], as Mhbh. 51 16, 29. — Cp. Pat. I, 59 [vRSalakulamanayorantarA] (between these two [families of brahmans] there dwells a family of çûdras), here [antarA] complies also with the gen., it seems.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Difference between is expressed not by a preposition, but by means of two genitives. R. 3, 47, 45 [yadantaraM siMhazRgAlayorvane yadantaraM syandanikAsamudrayoH / surAgryasovIrakayoryadantaraM tadantaraM dAzarathestavaiva ca] (what differente there is between lion and chacal in the forest, between a rivulet and the ocean, between ambrosia and the beverage of the Sauvîras, that is the difference between the son of Daçaratha and you), Mhbh. 12, 8, 15 [vizeSaM nAdhigacchAmi patitasyAdhanasya ca]. As to the dvandva-compounds in the first example see 207.</p>
