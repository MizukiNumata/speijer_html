    <p>168. {[A]}.</p>
    <p>[8] [A] always agrees <i>with the ablative</span>, and is put before its noun. It serves to denote the boundary or limit, either the terminus a quo or the terminus ad quem, mostly the latter. It is available both in space and in time, and may be rendered accordingly now by „since” and „till”, now by „from” and „to.” M. 2, 22 is an example illustrative of its signifying the two termini [A samudrAttu vai pUrvAdA samudrAttu pazcimAt / tayorevAntaraM giryoAryAvartaM vidurbudhAH] (the wise know Âryâvarta to be the country between</p>
    <p>the said mountains <i>from</span> the eastern ocean <i>to</span> the western).</p>
    <p>Other examples: 1. <i>term. a quo.</span> Çâk. I [A mUlAcchrotumicchAmi] (I wish to hear it from the root); Kathâs. 24, 186 [A bAlyAttApaso ‘bhavam] (since my childhood I was an ascetic);</p>
    <p>2. <i>term. ad quem.</span> Mhbh. 1, 163, 8 [A karNAddhinnadaktraH] (having his mouth split up to the ears), Çâk. IV [odakAntAtsnigdho jano’nugantavya iti zrUyate]; — Çâk. V [A prasavAdasmadgRhe tiSThatu] (let her stay with us till her delivery), Âçv. Grhy. 1, 19, 5 [A SoDazAd [viz. varSAd] brAhmaNasyAnanItaH kAla A dvAviMzAtkSattriyasyA caturviMzAdvaizyasya] (until the sixteenth year the time is not passed for the brahman, etc.). — In a figqrative sense f. i. Çâk. I [A paritoSAdviduSAM na sAdhu manye prayogavijJAnam] (I do not approve the skill of performing a representation, unless the connoisseurs be contented).</p>
    <p>[A] is often compounded with its noun into an avyayîbhâva. Daç. 175 [AkaNThaM papau] (he drunk his fill, liter. »till his throat”), Kathâs. 5, 103 [AsaMsAraM jagatyasminnekA nityA hyanityatA] (for, since the world exists, there is but one thing steady in the Creation, namely unsteadiness); Panc. I, 39 [AmaraNaM bhikSA] (a lifelong beggary).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the vaidik mantras [A] is of the utmost frequency, and is put to different cases, sometimes before, sometimes behind. In most instances it is rather a mere adverb. (*1).</p>

    <p>In a period a.a early as Yâska, [A] with loc. had antiquated, for this exegete deems it necenary to interprete the mantric expression [abhra A apaH] (water in the cloud) by [apo ‘bhre ‘dhi] (Nir. 5, 5). In a subsequent time the very gloss of Yâska would have required another, for [adhi] with loc. in this meaning being obsolete (156), classic Sanskrit would have employed [antaH] or [-madhye] or have said [abhragatA apaH].</p>
