    <p>As it has been stated above (15), this traditional order of words is liable to be modified by various influences of the power to cause the speaker to prefer an other arrangement. Instead of the subject, the word on which stress is laid will head the sentence. In this way the verb or an oblique noun-case or an adverb (especially when of time), are not seldom put first, because of emphasis. Hit. 97 <skt>santy evambhūtā bahavaḥ} (of the kind there exist many, indeed), Daç. 132 <skt>athāvocam / apasaratu dviradakīṭa eṣa / anyaḥ kaścin mātaṅgapatir ānīyatām} (then I said: let this miserable elephant be gone, bring an other, a number 1 of the elephants);” Hit. 110 <skt>mama balāni tāvad avalokayatu mantrī}; Panc. 39 <skt>rātrī tvayā maṭhamadhye na praveṣṭavyam}; ibid. 53 <skt>adyaiva tayā saha samāgamaḥ kriyatām} (meet with her still to-day). Absolute locatives and the like are also placed at the beginning, Bhojap. 8 <skt>guṛhīte bhoje lokāḥ kolāhalaṃ cakruḥ}, Hitop. 131 <skt>paśyato bakamūrkhasya nakulair bhakṣitāḥ sutāḥ}, Panc. 54 <skt>evaṃ tasya tāṃ nityaṃ sevamānasya kālo yāti}.</p>
    <p>Likewise in connecting sentences it is necessary to commence a new sentence or a new clause at the word, which relates to somebody or something mentioned in the foregoing. Hence demonstratives often head the sentence. Panc. 37 <skt>asti kasmiṃścid viviktapradeśe maṭhāyatanaṃ / tatra … parivrājakaḥ prativasati sma / tasya … mahatī vitta-mātrā saṃjātā / tataḥ sa na kasyacid viśvasiti}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In general, the manner in which sentences are linked together may be of some influence on the arrangement of words. So the type, represented by Hit. <skt>rājā sarvān śiṣṭān āhūya mantrayitum upaviṣṭaḥ / āha ca tān} [instead of <skt>tāścāha}], often occurs, especially in polished style. Cp. f. i. Daç. 139 <skt>ahaṃ ca … viṣaṃ kṣaṇād astambhayam / apatac ca sa bhūmau}, Harsha. 11 <skt>martyalokam avātarat / apaśyac ca}.</p>
    <p>On the other hand similar reasons may expel the verb from its place at the rear, substituting for it some other word, required there by economy of style, because the end of a sentence is also fit to give some emphasis to the word placed there. Ratn. III <skt>na khalu kiñcin na saṃbhāvyate tvayi} (in you there is nothing we may not look for), Daç. 97 <skt>na ced coritakāni pratyarpayasi drakṣyasi pāram aṣṭādaśānāṃ kāraṇānām ante ca mṛtyu-mukham} (if you do not restore to the citizens what you have stolen of them, you will know by experience the succession of the eighteen tortures, and at last the mouth of death); Kâd. I, p. 292 <skt>rājaputri kiṃ bravīmi vāgeva me nābhidheyaviṣayam avatarati trapayā}.</p>
    <p>There is much freedom, where to put the negations, as will be shown in the chapter, which treats of them.</p>
