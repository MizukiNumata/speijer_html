    <p>170. {[Arabhya] and [prabhRti]}.</p>
    <p>[Arabhya] and [prabhRti] <i>with preceding ablative</span> are very common. The former is properly a gerund = ,,beginning-, starting from,” [prabhRti] is construed with abl. by so-called syntactic analogy, see Rem. 2.</p>
    <p>Examples of [Arabhya] = since. Panc. 288 []; Mâlat. VI, p. 88 [mama zizukAlAdArabhyAzItirvaeSANi samanUvan] (since the day I have seen M. for the first time).</p>
    <p>Examples of [prabhRti] = since. Panc. 51 [bAlyAtprabhRti sahacAriNau]; Mâlat. III, p. 50 [manmathodyAnayAtrAdivasAtprabhRti] (since the day of the procession in the garden of Kâma); Mudr. II, p. 70 [AkSApaya kutaH prabhRti kathayAmi].</p>

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. [prabhRti] is originally a feminine, meaning »origin, commencement” and like its synonym [Adi], it is often used at the ends of bahuvrîhis (229 1 1°). At the outset, therefore, such a term as [tatkAlaprabhRti] was said in the very same acceptation as [tatkAlAdi], viz. meaning [sa kAlaH prabhRtiryasya tat]. By the time, however, the noun [prabhRti] ceased to be employed as a separate word, and one commenced to</p>
    <p>look upon the adverbial compounds, ending in [-prabhRti], as if they were ending in some preposition, meaning »since.” By this mistake it happened that [prabhRti] assumed even the character of a self-existent particle construed with ablative, by analogy of [Arabhya] and the like. Hence f. i. the compound [janmaprabhRti] »since his birth” (M. 8, 90) represents an older idiom than [janmanaH]. In such turns as [tadAprabhRti] (since then), [yadAprabhRti] (since when), [adyaprabhRti], the true nominal nature of [prabhRti] is plain, and it is again a misunderstanding to write them as two words [tadA prabhRti] etc.</p>
