    <p>171. {[upari]}.</p>
    <p>[10] [upari] (above, over, on, upon) is the very op­posite of [adhaH], see 163. As a rule, it is construed with preceding <i>genitive</span> (*1), unless it makes up the latter part of a compound: [tasyopari] or [tadupari]. Its employment is various, as it is used <i>a.</span>) of space, <i>b.</span>) of time »upon = immediately after,” <i>c.</span>) of rank, <i>d.</span>)= »on, upon about, concerning, with respect to,” then [upari] is concurrent with [prati] and with the <i>nimittasaptamî</span>, <i>e.</span>) = »before, under the eyes of.”</p>
    <p>Examples: <i>a.</span>) Kâç. on P. 8, 1, 7 [upari ziraso ghaTaH dhArayati] (he carries a jar upon his head), Panc. 125 [rAjJo vakSaH sthalopari makSikopaviSTA], Kathâs. 25, 228 [sa rAjA taddhemAbjaM], Panc. 112 [kopAttasyopari papAta] (moved by anger he made a bolt at him). — Metaphorically f. i. Panc. I, 166 [dezAnAmupari kSmAbhRdAturANAM cikitsakAH] etc. »the king lives on his dominions, physicians on the sick,” R. 3, 54, 28 [krodho mamApUrvo dhairyasyopari vardhate] (the fresh anger grows over my forbearance, that is: goes beyond my forb.);</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) Kâç. on P. 3, 3, 9 [upari muhUrtasyopAdhyAyazcedAgacchet] (if the teacher arrives after a moment) (*2);</p>
    <p><i>c.</span>) Kathâs. 6, 167 [tAM devInAmupari kRtavAn] (he honoured her above his queens);</p>
    <p><i>d.</span>) Panc. 142 [viraktiH saMjAtA me sAMprataM dezasyAsyopari] (I have now taken a dislike to this country), Mudr. III, p. 105 [aho rAjaparijanasya cANavyasyopari vidveSapakSapAtaH] (well, the king’s attendance are not friendly disposed towards Cāṇakya), Panc. 116 [kiM tava mamopari cintayA] (what have you to care for meP), ibid. 26 [na dInopari mahAntaH kupyantiH];</p>
    <p><i>e.</span>) Panc. 266 [prANatyAgaM tavopari kariSyAti] (I will kill myself before your eyes). Comp. 177.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Occasionally 3t1ff is con:itrµed with a locative. Kathâs. 3, 58 [uparyantaHpure sA ca ratnamityabhirakSthate]. — With ablative it is also sometimes met with, as in the passage of Utpala, quoted by Kern in his translation of Varâham. Brh. I, p. 7, which has been adduced 73 R. 3 (*3). Even the <i>accus.</span> with [upari] is not forbidden. Pâṇ. 8, 1, 7 teaches [upari], [adhi] and [adhaH] being put twice, when denoting a close nearness, as [uparyupari grAmam / adhyadhi grAmam]; here the accus. is standing (see the kârikâ quoted by Kâç. on P. 2, 3, 2). Çiçup. 1, 4 [navAnadho ‘dho bRhataH payodharAn], Mhbh. 1, 120, 9 [uparyupari gacchantaH zailarAjam](*4).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>So it ie taught by Pâṇini, as must be inferred by comparing P. 2, 3, 30 with 5, 3, 27-34.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>In full, the example given by the Kâçikâ, is [UrdhvaM muhUrtadupari muhUrtasya] etc. In the bad excerpt of the Calcutta edition of Pâṇini these words have been mutilated into [muhUrtadupari], which has deceived Boethlingk in his edition of Pâṇini and in hie Petr. Dict. (I, p. 968).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>The example of the Petrop. Dict. (<i>s. v.</span> V, p. 1191), Kathâs. 53, 125 [yAvatsvargAduparyagAt] is not convincing. It is rather probable, that the abl. should be construed with [yAvat] [169], [upari] being a mere adverb = »upward.” — For the rest, it is not strange that the wavering between abl. and gen. in construing adjectives and adverbs of space and time (125) appears also in the syntax of prepositions. Cp. 173 R. 1.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*4)</p>
    <p>It is no exception, that Nala. 1, 2 the gen. is used [uparyupari sarveSAm], since the repetition does not imply here the notion of proximity, the</p>
    <p>meaning being »[standing] high above all men.”</p>
