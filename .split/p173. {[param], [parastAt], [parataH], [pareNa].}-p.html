    <p>173. {[param], [parastAt], [parataH], [pareNa].}</p>
    <p>[12]. Akin to the old and obsolete [paraH] [160] classic Sanskrit possesses [param], [parastAt], [parataH] and [pareNa], all of them expressive of the notion <i>beyond</span>. When denoting space, they serve also to signify the <i>passing by</span> — especially [pareNa] with accus. — and the <i>surpassing</span> — espec. [parastAt] with genit. When denoting time, they are = „after” and comply with <i>ablative</span>.</p>
    <p>Examples: <i>a.</span>) of space and rank. Ait. Br. 8, 14, 3 [ye ke ca pareNa himavantaM janapadAH] (all countries beyontl the Himâlaya); Mhbh. 11 232, 11 [pareNAsmAnprehi] (»<i>pass by</span> us”, v. a. »do not harm us”); Kâm. 5, 61 [lakSmIrevAnvayo loke na lakSmyAH parato’nvayaH] (— nor does noble extraction <i>go beyond</span> wealth); Malâv. I, p. 1 [parastAdyatInAm] (who surpasses all ascetics).</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) of time: »after.” M. 2, 122 [abhivAdAtparam] (after the salutation), Panc. V, 58 [muhUrtAtparataH] (after a moment), Utt. III, p. 88 [stanyatyAgAtpareNa] (after leaving the breast). So the frequent phrases [ataH param], [tataH param] and the like.</p>

    <p>dazAhAdUrdhvam], Ait. Br. 2, 33, 5 [saMvatsarasya parastAt].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. As [param] etc. answer to Latin <i>ultra</span>, so [arvAk] is the equivalent of Lat. <i>citra</span>, I denoting the side next to us. When time-denoting, [arvAk] contrasted with [param] and the like is accordingly = »before;” then it may be construed with the ablative. M. 8, 30 [pranaSTasvAmikaM rikathaM rAjA tryabdaM nidhApayet / arvAk tryabdAddharetsvAmI pareNa nRpatirharet] (property the owner of which has disappeared, must be guarded by the king for three years. Before that term, the owner may reclaim it, afterwards it falls to the king).</p>
