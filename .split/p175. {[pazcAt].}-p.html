    <p>175. {[pazcAt].}</p>
    <p>Another word for ,,after” is [pazcAt]. When prepos., it complies <i>with a genitive</span> generally preceding, and is mostly used of space and rank. Kathâs. 6, 134 [ahaM prAvizaM mama pazcAcc zarvavarmA]; Panc. 181 [asya pazcAnnAnyaH suhRnme] (no friend I put after him).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. »After” in space may also be denoted by words meaning »west of” as [pratyak], by [pRSThe] (at the rear) and [jaghanena] (back). The last seems to be restricted to the old liturgical dialect.</p>
