    <p>Sanskrit poets, especially in the more artificial and refined kinds, display a still greater variety in arranging the parts of the sentence. We may account for it partly by the exigencies of versification, but for a good deal it is the effect of their aspiring after an elegant and exquisite diction. Yet, as deviation from the traditional order of words is not striven at for itself, the idiom of the poets is rather characterized by the richness and size of compounds, by the elegancy of words and the melodiousness of sounds, by the elevation and perfection of style, than by an artificially disturbed arrangement of words. Such entangled and intricate structure, as for example characterizes Latin poetry, is an exception in Sanskrit(*1). There it is chiefly displayed in the extraordinary great liberty in placing relatives, interrogatives and negations.</p>

The rhythmical disposition of the words is here prevailing on the regular arrangement required by logic, compare the figur <i>hyperbaton</span>, so much employed in Greek and Latin. — An other mark of antiquity is separating prepositions from their verbs, chiefly by particles put between them, as Ait. Br. 2, 31, 6 <skt>upa vā vadedanu vā vyāharet}.</p>
