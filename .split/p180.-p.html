    <p>Pâṇini enjoins also the ablative with [prati], in two cases viz, when pointing out <i>a</span>) one’s match or substitute, <i>b</span>) something given in exchange. {P. 1, 4, 92; cp. 2, 3, 11.} The Kâçikâ illustrates our rule by these examples: <i>a</span>). [pradyumnaH kRSNAt] or [kRSNataH prati] (Pr. the match or substitute of K.), <i>b</span>). [tintebhyaH prati yacchati mASAn] (in exchange of sesam he gives beans). I have nowhere met with instances of that construction in literature, but for one, I borrow textually from the Petr. Dict., viz. Mhbh. 3, 13287 [ukSANaM paktvA saha odanena asmAtkapotAtorati te nayantu]. Yet there are several instances in the ancient Vedic dialect as well as in classic Sanskrit of an <i>accus.</span> with [prati], when signifying the ,,match.” Rgv. 2, 1, 8 [tvaM sahasrANi zatA daza prati] (you are equal to thousands etc.), Kathâs. 45, 400 [na ca zaktastvamimaM prati] (nor are you a match for him).</p>
