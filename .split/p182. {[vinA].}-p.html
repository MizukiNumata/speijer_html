    <p>182. {[vinA].}</p>
    <p>[18] [vinA] (without) is construed with <i>instrumental</span>, <i>accusative</span> or <i>ablative</span>. {P. 2, 3, 32.} In prose it is commonly put behind its case(*1), in poetry it often precedes.</p>
    <p>Examples : with instrum. Panc. 266 [ahaM tvayA vinA nAtra vastuM zaknomi] (I cannot live here without you); — with accus. Panc. 269 [sA punarna zaktA tvAM vinA sthAtum] (but she cannot stay without you), R. 3, 9, 20 [na vinA yAti taM khaGgam] (he does not go abroad without that sword); — with ablat. Daç. 141 [tAdRzAd bhAgyarAzervinA] (without such a store of happiness), Var. Bṛh. 44, 17 [sa jayati tadA narendraH zatrUnacirAdvinA yatnAt].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Occasionally [vinA] may have the meaning of »save, if not”. Panc. I, 42 [vinA malayamanyatra candranaM na prarohati], ibid. p. 244 [na ca raktAkSaM vinA dhImAn] (there is nobody wise but Raktâxa).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Just as [vinA] are construed [pRthak] and [nAnA] »apart from.” {P. 2, 3, 32.} Of [nAnA], when a prepos., I can quote no instance from literature, of [pRthak] only with an ablat. Bhojapr. 27 [rAjadharmaH pRthagvidvaddharmAt] (the king’s duty lies outside the duty of the scholar), Prabodh. II, p. 84, Mudr. I, p. 48.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>But not always. Mudr. VII, p. 228 f. i. [vinaiva yuddhAdAryeNa parAjitam] it precedes, stress being laid upon it »<i>even without</span> striking a blow Your Excellence has vanquished.”</p>
