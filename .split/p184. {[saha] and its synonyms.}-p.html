    <p>184. {[saha] and its synonyms.}</p>
    <p>[19] Of [saha] ,,with” and its synonyms [samam], [sArdham], [sAkam] a full account has been given in the chapter on the instrumental (58). Mostly they precede the instrumental, they are complying with, but they may also be put behind or be separated from it by one or more interjacent words(*1). As they are, when without noun-case, adverbs meaning ,,together,” it is, exactly speaking, a pleonasm to put them to the instrumental, as the notion of concomitancy is already carried by that case.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Occasionally [saha] with instr. may even be expressive of the <i>instrument</span>. Kathâs. 37, 62 [prajvAlyAgniM sahendhanaiH] (after having inflamed the fire by combustibles). This idiom, though not of frequent occurrence in literature, must be very old, as it is met already in the Ath. Veda, see f. i. 8, 1, 11 [divyastvA mA dhAgvidyutA saha] (lest the Celestial burn thee with his lightning).</p>
