    <p>185. {[saha-] and [sa-] in compounds.}</p>
    <p>Compounding [saha] with its noun is allowed. {P. 6, 3, 82.} Yet in most cases to [saha-] one substitutes [sa-], either of them being the former member of the compound. It is exactly the same to say [rAmaH sasItaH] or [rAmaH saha sItAya]. An instance of interchanging [saha-] and [sa-] may be Veṇ. II, p. 48 [sahabhRtyagaNaM sabAndhavaM sasutaM sahAnujaM / svabalena nihanti…pANDusutaH suyodhanam].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Some cases are taught by Pâṇini, where [saha] is required to be the compound’s former member, not [sa], some others in which on the contrary [sa] must be used. Thus [saha-] is wanted <i>a</span>) in time-denoting adverbs as [sahapUrvAhNam] (the forenoon included), <i>b</span>) in blessings as [asmai sahaputrAya svasti bhUyAt] (hail to him with his son). {P. 6, 3, 81.} Yet the phrases [savatsAya -], [sagave -], [sahalAya svasti bhUyat] are admitted as equally good as [sahavatsAya] and the rest. {P. 6, 3, 83.}</p>
    <p>But [sa-] — not [saha-] — is required <i>a</span>) in all compound adverbs, not expressive of time, therefore exclusively in such terms as [saroSam] (with anger), [sabahumAnam] (respectfully), Daç, 84 [salajjaJca saharSaJca sasaMbhramaJca mAmabhASata] (he addressed me in a manner adapted to his shame, to his joy and to his excitement) and so often {P. 6, 3, 78-81.}; — <i>b</span>) in some special phrases, as [sakalaM jyotiSamadhIte] — not [sahakalaM] —, [vedaH savedAGgaH], and the like.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. [sArdham] and [samam] are seldom compounded with their noun. If this be the case, they make up the latter member. Panc. 276 [vAkasamameva ca brAhmaNI jIvitA sA] (with these very words the wife of the brahman was restored to life).</p>
