    <p>186. {1.[samayA], [nikaSA] 2.[abhitaH] etc.}</p>
    <p>Finally we must mention some prepositions, not spoken of in the foregoing, viz. 1st [samayA] and [nikaSA], both = ,,near, about,” 2ly [abhitaH], [paritaH], [sarvataH], [samantataH] (round, about, on all sides), [ubhayataH] (on both sides). All of them agree with the <i>accusative</span>. {Vârtt. on P. 2, 3, 2.}</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. Daç. 146 [samayA saudhabhittaM…prasuptamaGganAjanamalakSayam];</p>
    <p>2. Kathâs. 33, 113 [abhitaH kSetraM pAzAndattvA]; R. 2, 103, 21 [sItA purastAdvrajatu tvamenAmabhito vraja]; Kathâs. 18, 5 [taM sAmantAH parito bhrerdhruvaM grahagaNA iva] (on his sides his vassals marched� like the hosts of stars round the polar-star).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. A genitive with [abhitaH], [samantataH] is rare, but it seems it is regular with [samantAt]. Panc. 185 [tasya nyagrodhasya samantAtparibhramati].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. In modern writings [viSvak] with gen. = ,,on all sides,”</p>
