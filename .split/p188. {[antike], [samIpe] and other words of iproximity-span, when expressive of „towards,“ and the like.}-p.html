    <p>188. {[antike], [samIpe] and other words of <i>proximity</span>, when expressive of „towards,“ and the like.}</p>
    <p>In the first place: the loc., acc. and abl. of nouns, meaning <i>proximity</span>, <i>vicinity</span>, <i>neighbourhood</span> (as [antike], [samIpa], [saMnidhi]) or the <i>side</span> ([pArzva]) and similar, are a means for expressing ,,near; to, towards; from.” This periphrase is especially employed to signify a moving towards or from a <i>person</span>. ,,He has come to me” [madantikaM [or [-ke]] AgataH] or [matsakAzam], [matsamIpam], [matpArzvam] etc., ,,he is gone from me” [matpArzvApayAtaH] etc.</p>
    <p>Examples : 1. moving <i>to a person</span>. Accus. and locat. of the periphrasing noun. — <i>antika</span>: Daç. 19 [bAlaM…bhavadantikamAnItavAnasmi], Panc. 269 [tavAntike tamAneSyAmi]; — <i>sakâça</span>: Mrcch. III, p. 125 [maitreya gaccha vasantasenAyAH sakAzam] (M., go to V.), Panc. 262 [ahaM tvatsakAze maitryarthamAgataH] (I have come to you for friendship); — <i>samîpa</span>: Hit. 22 [asya samIpamupagacchAmi], Panc. 178 [bhUyo’pi satvaraM citrAGgasamIpe gataH]; — <i>pârçva</span>: Panc. 257 [vAnarapArzvamagamat], ibid. 55 [bhagavAnnArAyaNaH kanyakApArzve’bhyeti]; - <i>saṃnidhi</span>: Daç. 133 [AdAya cainaM mama pitroH saMnidhimanaiSam]; — <i>nikata</span>: Kathâs. 24, 66 [brAhmaNaM taM visRSTavAn…duhiturnikaTaM tadA] (then he allowed that brahman to go to his daughter), Bhojapr. 60 [rAjanikaTe nItaH]; — <i>abhyarna</span>: Daç. 36 [vanitAM…matpiturabhyarNaMmAbhagamayya] (conducted the woman to my father and —); — <i>upakanṭha</span>: Daç;. 39 [taduNkaNThamupetya]. This list may</p>
    <p>easily be enlarged. From the archaic dialect I add an instance of [ardha] being equivalent with [pArzva]. Ch. Up. 5, 3, 4 [sa hAyastaH piturardhameyAya] (he went sorrowful to his father).</p>
    <p>2. moving <i>from a person</span>. Ablat. of the periphrasing noun. — Kathâs. 10, 26 [zrIdattaH saha tairmitraistatsamIpAdapAsarat] (Çrîd. with his friends withdrew from him), Ragh. 5, 24 [raghoH sakAzAdanuvApya kAmaM / gataH] (gone from Raghu, without having obtained his desire), Mrcch. X, p. 375 [apanIyatAmayaM cArudattapArzvAt].</p>
    <p>3. Staying <i>near</span>. Locat. of the periphrasing noun. — Âçv. Gṛhy. 1, 18, 7 [sthitvAhaH zeSamAcAryasakAze vAcaM visRjeta], Panc. 277 [kUpopakaNThe vizrAnto brAhmaNaH], ibid. 160 [dhavalagRhapArzve] = »near the white house.” When attending on persons, the periphrasing nouns may of course be = »in the presence of,” thus being synonymous with [puraH], [agre] and the like (177). Hence they may occasionally denote the person addressed to. R. 3, 10, 9 [hati mayA vyAhUtaM dvijasaMnidhau] (so I have spoken to the brahmans).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. By so called syntactic analogy [sakAzAt] is occasionally construed with the abl. instead of the gen. of the noun, it qualifies. Varâh. Bṛh. 104, 12 [vairakumArakebhyo bhaumaH sakAzAtphalamAdadhAti] (Mars takes away the fruit of thieves and princes).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Kathâs. 2o, 129 we have [antikena] = »near,” [zmazAnasyAntikena sa…azRNodgiram].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. [pArzvataH], [samIpataH], [sakAzataH] sometimes have the worth of ablatives, but sometimes also that of locatives, f. i. Kathâs. 32, 99 [astohekSumato nAma puro tasyAzca pArzvataH / nadI] — and nt its side a river), cp. Nala 6, 4.</p>
