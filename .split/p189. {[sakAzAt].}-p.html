    <p>Moreover [sakAzAt] — and also, but not so often, [antikAt] and [pArzvAt] — serves also to periphrase many other kinds of ablative, especially if = ,,from the side of <i>a person</span>”. So Panc. 28 [svAminaH sakAzAdabhayadakSiNA dApayitavyA [sc. [tvayA]]] (you must procure me safety from the side of your master), ibid. 137 [bhozcitragrIvasya mayA tava sakAzAtpAzamokSaNaM dRSTaM / tena mama mahatI prItiH saMjAtA / tatkadAcinmamApi vandhane jAte tava pArzvAnmuktairnavati] (well, I have seen how you have loosened Citragrîva of his fetters, and I was much pleased at this, for I too, if perchance I should get into captivity, may be released from your side); — to receive from: Mṛcch. X, p. 341 [icchAmyahaM bhavataH sakAzAtpratigrahaM kartum]; — to ask from: Panc. 75 [mayA tvatsakAzAdbhojanamarthanIyam]; — to learn from: M. 2, 20 [etaddezaprasUtasya sakAzAdagrajanmanaH / svaMsvaM caritraM zikSeranpRthivyAM sarvamAnavAH]; — to buy from: M. 9, 174 [krINIyAdyastvapatyArthaM mAnApitroryamantikAt / sa krItakaH] (he whom somebody has bought from his parents that he might be instead of a son, is called his bought son); — to be borne from: Panc. 318 [mama kanyAM dAsyati tatsakAzAtputro me bhaviSyati] (he will give me his daughter, of her I shall have a son). — Abl. of comparison: Panc. 271 [atastaM saMmAnAdibhiH sarveSAM rAjaputrANAM] (from this time he looked on him with favour above all rajputs, showing his grace by marks of honour and the like), Vajracched. p. 16 [asya khalu puNyaskandhasyAntikAdasau paurvakaH puNyaskandhaH zatatamImapi kalAM nArhati] (forsooth, if compared to the foresaid bulk of good works, this second bulk of good works is not equal to the hundredth part of it).</p>
