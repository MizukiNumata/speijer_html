    <p>19. Real and grammatical gender and number.</p>
    <p>A twofold agreement is here to be spoken of, one existing between idea and word (I), the other between words standing in the same sentence (II).</p>
    <p>I. As a rule, there is agreement between the real and the grammatical gender and number. As to the number, an exception is to be stated for the collective nouns and some <i>pluralia tantum</span>, as <skt>āpaḥ} (water), <skt>prāṇāḥ} and <skt>asavaḥ} (life), <skt>varṣāḥ} (the rainy season), in the elder language also <skt>jatravaḥ} (collar-bone), <skt>grīvāḥ} (neck) (*1). Rarely the gender disagrees, as the neuter <skt>mitra} »friend,” words as <skt>bhājata}, <skt>pātra} »vessel; fit person,” f. i. Mhbh. 1, 61, 3 <skt>śrotuṃ pātraṃ ca rājaṃstvam} (you are the proper man to hear—) <skt>daivata} (n.) and <skt>devatā} (f.) »deity,” etc; — <skt>dārāḥ} masc. plur. »wife” is an instance of disagreement in both gender and number (*2).</p>
    <p>The diminutives generally retain the gender of their primitives (*3): <skt>putraka} m. as <skt>putra}, but f. as <skt>putrī}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Of the collectives some are not always used so; <skt>jana} f. ex. may as well denote a single individual as a collection of individuals. Accordingly, in the latter case it may be said as well <skt>janaḥ} (sing.) as <skt>janāḥ} (plur.)(*4). Similarly <skt>lokaḥ} or <skt>lokāḥ} »people, <i>le monde</span>, <i>les gens</span>” <skt>prajā} or <skt>prajāḥ} »offspring; subjects.”</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Still Pâṇini seems to have known it but as a plural, for in teaching taddhitas derived from it, he says <skt>grīvābhyo [not grīvāyāḥ] ‘ṇ ca} P. 4, 3, 57. Compare the similar development of Latin <i>cervix</span> out of the pl. tant. <i>cervices</span>, see Quintilian VIII, 3, 35.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p><skt>dāra} is used as a singular in the Dharmasûtra of Âpastamba (see I, 32, 6; II, 1, 17; 5, 10; 11, 12; 22, 7, etc.).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>Words in <skt>a} have, however, sometimes diminutives in <skt>ī}. So {śastrī} (a small dagger = <skt>asiputrī} Amar. k.), whereas <skt>śastra} (n.) more especially »sword.”</p>

    <p>So Nala. 6, 11 <skt>tataḥ paurajanāḥ sarva mantribhiḥ saha bhārata / rājānaṃ draṣṭumāgacchan}, but in the subsequent çloka we read <skt>tataḥ sūta upāgamya damayantyai nyavedayat / eṣa paurajano devi dvāri tiṣṭhati kāryavān}<i>.</span></p>
