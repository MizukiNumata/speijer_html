    <p>193. {[kRte], [hetoH]; [artha], [nimitta], [kAraNa] etc., expressive of cause, motive, aim.}</p>
    <p>Several periphrasing words may signify <i>for the sake of</span>, <i>because of</span>, <i>for</span>, viz. 1 [kRte] used almost as a real preposition, 2. [hetoH] the ablative(*1) of [hetu] „motive,” 3. [artham], [arthAya] and [arthe], the acc., dat. and loc. of [artha] (matter, sake), 4. the instrum., accus. and abl. of [nimitta] and [kAraNa] „cause, motive.” They are construed with <i>preceding</span> genitive, if they do not make up the latter part of a compound.</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. [kRte]. — Panc. IV, 29 [na svalpasya kRte bhUri nAzayet] (one must not spend much for the sake of little); Mṛcch. IV, p. 131 [mayA khalu madanikAyAH kRte sAhasamanuSThitam]; Panc. IV, 51 [vAkakRte rAsabho hataH] (the ass was killed for his voice).</p>
    <p>2. [hetoH]. — Bhagavadgîtâ 1, 35 [etAnna hantumicchAmi…api traulophyarAjyasya hetoH kiM nu mahIkRte] (them I would not kill… not even for the sake</p>
    <p>of the realm of the three worlds, how much less for the possession of land); Çâk. V [svasukhanirabhilASAH khidyase lokahetoH] (while not caring for your own pleasure, you tire yourself for the sake of your people); Ragh. 2, 47 [alpasya hetorbahu hAtumicchanvicAramUDhaH pratibhAsi me tvam] (you seem to me a thoughtless fool, that you desire to give up much for a trifle); Mâlat. IV, p. 65 [jIvitatrANahetoH] = [jIvitatrANAya]. — Note [kasya hetoH] (why?), [kasyApi hetoH] (for some motive) and the like.</p>
    <p>3. <i>a.</span>) [artham]. — Panc. 169 [jalArthaM tadeva pulonamavatIrNaH] (he is gone to the same bank for water), ibid. 212 [ulUkAdhipo vAyasavadhArthaM pracalitaH] (— set out in order to kill the crows), Mṛcch. m, p. 116 [madanikAyA niSkrayaNArthaM vasantasenAgRhaM gacchAmi]; R. 3, 35, 34 [amRtAnayanArthaM cakAra manim] (he made up his mind to feich the amṛta). It is plain, that [artham] is in all such phrases the equivalent of a final dative. Cp. 87.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>It is not quite plain, how Pâṇini did account for [hetoH]. Yet, his commentators and followers consider it a <i>genitive</span>, and it is very likely, he bas thought so himself. At least, we may draw the inference. After having taught in his sûtra 2, 3, 26 [SaSThI hetuprayoge], that is the genitive is required [instead of the inatrum. of causality] when employing [hetu]”, he adds this clause (s. 27) [sarvanAmnastRtIyA ca], but in the case of a pronoun of the class <i>sarva</span> etc., either the gen. or the instrum.” With the said pronouns it is therefore allowed to use two idioms promiscuously — f. i. [kasya hetoH] and [kena hetunA], but for the rest the only idiom available is that, which is exemplified by [puruSasya hetoH]. Now, as [kena] and [hetunA] are <i>both</span> instrumentals, it is but consistent that of [kasya hetoH], the parallel idiom, <i>both</span> elements are meant as genitives. Then, of course [puruSasya hetoH] must also be considered as genitives both. The very words of Pâṇini do not admit of another intepretation.</p>
    <p>But however great the authority of Pâṇini may be, as it is, when he states facts and describes phenomena, there is no plausible reason to follow it, where his explication of them is wrong. To him, who did not know but one language, [hetoH] could appear as a genitive, but for us, who have the opportunity of comparing similar idioms in different languages, f. ex. Latin <i>causâ</span> and <i>gratiâ</span>, English <i>because of</span>, it is impossible not to take [hetoH] for an <i>ablatitive of causality</span>. By doing so we account for the idiom in question in a quite satisfactory manner. Therefore [kasya hetoH] is to be compared with Latin <i>cujus rei causa</span>, not with <i>qua de causa</span>, the Sanskrit equivalent of which is [kasmAddhetoH].</p>
    <p>[kasmAddhetoH] reminds me of the vârtt. on P. 2, 3, 27 [nimittakAraNahetuSu sarvAsAM prAyadarzanam]. This precept is strictly true by itself — the word [prAya] shows sufficiently that it must not be urged too much — but it cannot be said with some reason, Pâṇini has left out this rule, as he did not want to enjoin it at all.</p>
