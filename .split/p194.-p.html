    <p>The foresaid apparatus for expressing the <i>purpose</span>; the <i>aim</span>, the <i>motive</span>, the <i>sake</span>, though the most common, is not the sole, [artha], [nimitta], [kAraNa], [mUla], [hetu] etc. serving also for this purpose, when being part of a bahuvrîhi. Daç. 75 f. i. [vismayaharSamUlaH kolAhalo lokasyodajihIta] (from astonishment and joy people burst out into clamour). A fair sample of manifoldness of expression we have in these lines from the Râmâyaṇa</p>
    <p>[na zobhArthAvimau bAhU dhanurbhUSaNAya</p>
    <p>nAsirAbandhanArthAya na zarAH stambhhetavaH] (2, 23, 31),</p>
    <p>in each pâda a different way has been followed to signify the aim. In the first [artha] is the latter member of a bahuvrîhi, in the</p>
    <p>fourth [hetu], in the second the dative of the aim has been used, and the third has periphrase by means of [arthAya]. Cp. R. 3, 43, 17; Nala 14, 19.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. It is prain that datives as [arthAya], [nimittAya], [hetave] will signify but the <i>purpose</span> or <i>aim</span>, whereas ablatives as [kAranAt], instrumentals as [nimittena], compounds in [-mUla] are only expressive of the <i>cause</span>. But in some of the foresaid implements for periphrase, as [kRte], [artham], [nimittam], [hetoH], the contrast, which does logically exist between the conceptions »aim” and »cause” is not to be found. Strictly speaking, they are standing on the neuter territory of the »motive” which partakes of both. See the examples given.</p>
