    <p>Some participles in [-ta] may serve the want of periphrase, as:</p>
    <p>1. {[gata]} [gata], often used as an equivalent of the locative, as it may be rendered by <i>in</span>, <i>into</span>, <i>to</span>, <i>towards</span>, Panc. 155 [AvayorhastagataM jAtam] (it has come <i>into</span> our hand), .Mâlav. I, p. 12 [gavAkSagatA tiSThati] (she stands <i>at</span> the window), M. 2, 218 [gurugatAM vidhyAM zuzrUSuradhigacchati], here [gurugatA vidhyA] = [guro vidhyA] »the wisdom which dwells in his teacher.” Panc. 272 a lion takes up the helpless young of a chacal holding it between his teeth [daMSTrAmadhyagataM] = [daMSTrAmadhye kRtvA]. Likewise R. 3, 46, 6 [janasthAnagatA drumAH] = [janasthAne santo drumAH] »the trees in Jan.”</p>
    <p>Examples of [gata], periphrasing the nimittasaptamî (147). R. 3, 43, 48 [pazya lakSmaNa vaidehyA mRgatvaci gatAM spRhAM] (Laxmaṇa, look how fond Sîtâ is of the skin of the antelope), Çâk. I [sakhIgataM kimapi pRcchAmaH] (I will</p>
    <p>ask something concerning your friend).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Occasionally [saMzrita], [Azrita] and the like are used in this manner. See f. i. R. 3, 11, 65 and 3, 54, 26.</p>
