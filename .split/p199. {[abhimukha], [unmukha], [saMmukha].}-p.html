    <p>To them we may subjoin, as they do duty of participles, the adjectives [abhimukha], [unmukha], [saMmukha] when pointing out the direction of a movement. Then their proper meaning ,,[having] the face [turned] to” has dwindled down to a mere <i>to</span> or <i>towards</span> = [prati]. They are often used so, either as adjectives, or adverbially. — Examples of adjective: Panc. 208 [svapurAbhimukhaH pratisthe] which is identical with [svapuraM (or [svapuraM]) pratasthe]; ibid. 299 [mAtuH saMmukho gataH] = [mAtuH sakAze gataH]; — of adverb: Panc. 64 [sA svagRhAbhimukhaM pratisthe].</p>
