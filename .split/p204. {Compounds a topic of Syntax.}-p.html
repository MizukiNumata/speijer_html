    <p>204. {Compounds a topic of Syntax.}</p>
    <p>In western languages compounds are not considered a topic of Syntax. The fact of their being made up of two or more self-existent words — however important for the etymologist — has little or nothing to do with their employment in speaking or writing. In Sanskrit it must be otherwise. Keeping apart such compounds as have got any special meaning, which stamps them to unities (*1), there exists in that language an almost illimited freedom of expressing any kind of relations, grammatical or logical, by the way of compounding. Every moment the speaker and especially the writer of Sanskrit may have the opportunity of substituting compounds to the analytical mode of expression. For this reason, Sanskrit Syntax has to deal with compounds, as far as regards giving an account of the part they are acting in the phraseology and of the modes and ways how to employ them, whereas it is a topic of Sanskrit Etymology to expound their structure and their outer shape.</p>
    <p>The three great classes of compounds, set up by vernacular grammar, are dvandva, tatprusha, bahuvrîhi. They include nearly all varieties as well of the simple compounds, which are made up of hut two non-compound words, as of those, which are most intricate and of an immoderate length. Outside of them, there remains only the class of such compounds as are produced by putting together the preposition + the noun-case depending on it, as [AkaNTham] etc. (152) (*2); in most cases this fourth class coincides with the avyayîbhâva of vernacular grammar (*3).</p>

    <p>Such as [himAlaya] when the name of the mountain, [mahAtman] »noble,” [bhUsura] »brahman,” [saptarSayaH] the well-known constellation, [abalA] »woman,” and the like.</p>

    <p>WHITNEY <i>Sanskrit Grammar</span> § 1310 calls them »prepositional compounds.”</p>
    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>All <i>compound adverbs</span>, the former member of which is an indeclinable word, are comprehended by the general appellation <b>avyayîbhâva</span> (P. 2, 1, 5-16). Moreover this category contains some few kinds of compound adverbs, whose former member is a noun-case or an adj.; they are summed up by Pâṇini (2, 1, 17-21). — But <i>compound adjectives</span> are never styled avyayîbhâva, even if their former member be an indeclinable word. So for example when saying [rAmaH sasItaH], we have a »prepositional compound” indeed, [sasItaH] being = [saha sItayA], but not an avyayîbhâva.</p>
