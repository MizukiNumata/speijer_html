    <p>205. {Dvandva.}</p>
    <p>The <b>dvandva</span> serves to express concatenation and addition. Two or more nouns linked to another by „and” may be united into a dvandva. {P. 2, 2, 29.} So instead of saying [rAmo lakSmaNazca] we may use the dvandva [rAmalakSmaNau], instead of [striyo bAlAzca vRddhAzca] it may be said [strIbAlavRddhAH].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the archaic dialect the freedom of making dvandvas was very little. At least in the vaidik writings dvandvas are almost bound to set formulae and do never consist of more than two members. Most of them are dvandvas of divinities, especially in the mantras, such as [mitrAvaruNA], [indrAgnI]. See WHITNEY, <i>Sanskrit Grammar</span> § 1255 and 1256.</p>
