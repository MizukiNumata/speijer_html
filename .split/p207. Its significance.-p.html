<p>207. Its significance.</p>
<p>Besides its most common duty of expressing coordination, the dvandva is also available, if „and” connects persons or things standing in mutual relation with one another. Another species is the distributive dvandva.</p>
<p>Examples of the dvandva of relationship. — R. 3, 27, 10 [sa saMprahArastumulo rAmatrizirasostadA / saMvabhUvAtivalinoH siMhakuJjarayoriva] (then a wild battle began between Rama and Triçiras, both of extraordinary strength, as if between a lion and an elephant), Mâlav. I, p. 21 [atrabhavataH kila mama ca samudrapalvalayorivAntaram] (forsooth, there is as great a difference between you and me, as there is between a pond and the ocean), Harshac. 5 [nisargavirodhinI ceyaM payaHpAvakayorivaikatra dharmakrodhayArvRttiH] (and like water and fire, so righteousness and auger, [when meeting] at the same place, by their proper nature combat each other).</p>
<p>Examples of distributive dvandva. — Mâlav.

I, p. 19 [dvitayaM] phalaM kopaprItyordviSati ca vibhaktaM suhRdi ca] (I have bestowed the double fruit of my wrath and my affection on foe and friend); Kathâs. 25, 229: Açokadatta by his utmost bravery has conquered a golden lotus and presents it to the king his master, who puts the precious flower in a silver vase; on that account the poet makes this comparison [ubhau kalazapadmau ca zuzubhAte sitAruNau / yazaHpratApAviva tau bhUpAlAzokadattayoH] (and both the vase and tho flower shone, one white, the other red, as if they were that splendour and that glory combined, which adorned one tho king·, tho other Açokadatta),</p>
