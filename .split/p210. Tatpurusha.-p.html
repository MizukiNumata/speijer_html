    <p>210. Tatpurusha.</p>
    <p>The <<b>>tatpurusha</span> serves to express in a condensed shape a noun — substantive or adjective — together with some other noun qualifying it, as [tatpuruSaH] = [tasya puruSaH] (his man), [ahihataH] = [ahinA hataH] (bitten by a serpent), [navayauvanam] = [navaM yauvanam] (the first youth). The noun qualifying is the former member of the tatpurusha; the</p>
    <p>noun qualified, which is at the same time the main element, its latter member (*1).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The efficient elements of a tatpurusha are not of necessity self-existent words. The former part may be such a particle as [su-], [duH-], [a-], see 218. The latter may be a kṛt, not otherwise used but in compounds, as [-ja], [-ga], [-stha], [-jJa], [-kSa], [-bhuj], [-bhAj], [-zaya], [-kRt], [-kArin], [-bhojin], [-hArin] etc. Many of these compounds have got a special meaning so as to make them indissoluble unities, as [aNDaja] »bird,” [kumbhakAra] »potter,” [kiMkara] »servant.” Yet free compounding is also allowed. So Panc. I, 103 [kauzeyaM kRmijam] may be analyzed into [kau- kRmerjAtam], ibid. p. 28 [prasAdasaMmukho naH svAmI vacanavazagazca =[vacanavaze gataH]], Bhojapr. 2 [loko ‘yaM mAMsarvajJaM vakti], Panc. 41 [samIpavirtini nagare [= samIpe vartamAne na-]].</p>

    <p>Pat. I, p. 392 [uttarapadArthapradhAnastatpuruSaH]. In the same way the dvandva is styled [ubhayapadArthapradhAnaH], the bahuvrîhi [anyapadArthapradhAnaH], and the avyayîbhâva [pUrvapadArthapradhAnaH].</p>
