    <p>The former member may be either = a noun-case (as in [tatpuruSaH], [ahihataH]), or = an adjective (as in [navayauvanam]). In the latter case, there exists grammatical concord between the two members; such tatpurushas bear the special appellation of <b>karmadhâraya</span>.</p>

    <p>The faculty of combining adjectives with their substantives into karmadhârayas is theoretically almost unrestricted, but in practice not all possible combinations are used (*2). Most karmadhârayas are terms often recurring which <i>either</span> have got some special meaning, <i>or</span> are wont to be much employed though nothing impedes expressing them by the two elements severed. Of the former kind are such as [paramAtmA] (the highest soul), [yuvarAjaH] (heir apparent), of the latter such as [kRSNasarpaH] (a black serpent), [pakvAnnam] (cooked rice), and the great class of compounds, a full account of which</p>
    <p>is given by Pâṇini in the first adhyâya of his second ashtakam (see espec. the sûtras 49, 58, 61, 67 and 70), containing those, the former member of which is a pronoun as [sarva], [eka], [apara], [sva], and such adjectives as [nava], [purANa], [mahA-], [madhya], [madhyam], [sat] (good) etc. To them we may add such words as [nija], [mukhya], [pradhAna], and even such as begin by [su-], [duH-] and the negation [a-], as [sujanaH] (an honest man), [durjanaH] (a bad man), [akovit] (not skilled) .</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>Pâṇini’s rule 2, 1, 57 [vizeSaNaM vizeSyeNa bahulam] plainly shows not all combinations of the kind to be allowed.</p>
