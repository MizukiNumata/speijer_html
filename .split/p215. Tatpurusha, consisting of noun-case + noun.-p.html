    <p>215. Tatpurusha, consisting of noun-case + noun.</p>
    <p>Among such tatpurushas as are made up of <i>a noun-case + the noun qualified by it</span>, by far the most common are those, whose former part is to be periphrased by a genitive, as [rAjapuruSaH] = [rAjJaH puruSaH], [zatruvadhaH] = [zatrArdhaH] or [zatrvoH] or [zatrUNAm]. As this type is met with on every page, it is useless to quote instances from literature. Another frequent type is that, represented by [ahihataH] = [ahinA hataH]. Panc. 118 [gurujanAnujJAtaH] = [gurujanenAnujJAtaH], ibid. V, 93 [rAkSasendragRhItaH] (seized by the prince of giants), Bhojapr. 7 [soâ€™pi tadAkarNya vajrAhata iva bhUtAviSTa iva grahagrasta iva].</p>
    <p>For the rest, any noun-case may become the former part of a tatpurusha, as [mAsakalyANaH] = [mAsaM kalyANaH] (happy for a month), [mAtRsadRzaH] = [mAtrA] or [mAtuH sadRzaH] (resembling his mother), [yUpadAru] = [yUpAya dAru] (wood for a sacrificial stake), [vRkabhayam] = [vRkAt] or [vRkebhyo bhayam] (fear of a wolf or of wolves), [sthAlIpAkaH] = [sthAlyAM pAkaH] (cooking in a pot).</p>
