    <p>217. additions to the rules of Pâṇini thereabout.</p>
    <p>This list of possible kinds of tatpurushas, made up of noun-case + noun, is however not complete, as will soon appear, if one undertakes to systematize the tatpurushas occurring in fact in some literary work (*1). So, among others, Pâṇini does not mention the abl. of comparison, compounded with [anya] and [itara]; the instrumental + words expressive of plenty; the accus. with the participial adjectives in [-u]. Then, many more participles, whose former part is some noun-case, are in common use, though not necessarily, if at all, implied by the foresaid rules.</p>
    <p>1. abl. of comparison +[anya], especially, if the former part be a pronoun, as Hit. 30 [bhavadanyo mayA kaH suhRtprAptavyaH], Panc. I, 12 trade is said to be the best means for making money, [tadanyaH [sc. upAyaH] saMzayAtmakaH] (any other but this is dangerous).</p>
    <p>2. abl. of compar. + [itara]. — Such compounds are an elegant paraphrase, while calling something: the contrary of its opposite. So [dakSiNetara] = [savya] »left,” [sulabhetara upAyaH] (a difficult expedient), Daç. 175 [tayA navavadhvA dveSamalpetaraM babandha] (he bore his newly married wife a heavy grudge).</p>
    <p>3. instrum. + word expressive of plenty. Of the kind are those in [-AThya], [-pracura], [-samAkula] etc Panc. 319 [UrNApracuro’yaM meSaH], ibid. 7 [siMhavyAghrasamAkule’sminvane].</p>
    <p>4. accus. + adjective in [-u] derived of a desiderative. Panc. 3 [nAhamarthalipsuH], M. 7, 197 [yudhyeta jayaprepsurapetabhIH].</p>
    <p>5. Instances of noun-cases + participles are manifold and often met with. First, such as where the former part represents a sociative instrumental, as Panc. I, 164 [saMmAnasaMyuktAH sevakAH], ibid. I, 229 [bhAryA parasaMgatA] (a wife, who holds illicit intercourse with another). — Then, such as are expressive of separation (82), Panc. I, 35 [sevAvivarjitaH] (abstaining from attendance), ibid. p. 1 [putrA vivekarahitAH] (sons, deprived of discernment), ibid. I, 189 [saMmAnavihInaH], cp. 198. — Further locatives + [sthita], [gata] (cp. 197), [jAta], [utpanna] etc., as R. 3, 31, 2 [janasthAnasthitA rAkSasAH] (the rāxasas, staying at Janasthāna), Panc. I, 128 [sadaivApadgato rAjA bhogyo bhavati mantriNAm] (when being in distress, a king is always the prey of his ministers), ibid. I, 104 [mUSikA gRhajAtApi hantavyA], Kathâs. 42, 149 [aGghripatitaH] (fallen at their feet), — Or the former member is a dative or loc. of purpose: Panc, I, 125 [rAjyalAbhodhyato vRtraH] (Vrtra, striving for obtaining the royalty); an accusative: ibid, p 37 [saMjIvakAnuraktaH] (attached to S.); an abl. of origin: ibid. p. 2 [kulaprasUtasya] (of one born from a respectable family); a loc. of reference: ibid. I, 15 [goSThikakarmaniyuktaH]. And so on.</p>
    <p>6. As to the compound adjectives, they may generally be said to be comprised by the rules of Pâṇini, as their former part is a genitive or may be accepted as such. Among them are to be noticed [yogya], [anurUpa], [ucita], [samartha], those of skill and ability as [vicakSaNa], [abhijJa], [kovit], then such as [sadRza], [sama] (cp. 216, III <i>b.</span>) Panc. 17 [rAjA bhRtyAnuttamapadayogyAn hInAdhamasthAne niyojayati], ibid. 21 [] (his strength will be in proportion to his voice), ibid. 27 [bhavAnvacanapaTurdRzyate], ibid. 13 [kathamahaM sevAnabhijJaH]. Even indubitable dative-like genitives are compounded with the adjectives, which they qualify. Panc. p. 1 [rAjA tAn zAstravimukhAnAlovya] (as the king understood they were averse to the çâstras —). Panc. p. 1 affords even this instance of a tatpur., made up of a dat. of interest + subst., when calling some king [sakalArthikalpadrumaH] (v. a. a blessing for all the indigent).</p>
    <p>7. Compounds made up of a genitive + agent in [-tR], though explicitly interdicted by Pâṇini, are in fact met with. Panc. I, 2 [namo’stu nayazAstrakartRbhyaH], ibid. p. 7 [tasya maGgalavRSabhau dhUrvoThArau sthitau] (two splendid bulls drew his chariot).</p>
    <p>8. Finally we may set up a category apart for such tatpurushas, the former part of which is a noun-case, doing more or less duty of an adverb. Panc. 21 [na yuktaM svAminaH pUrvopArjitaM vanaM tyaktum], here [pUrvopArjita] = [pUrvamupArjita] »acquired before,” Kathâs. 29, 82 [vyAjasapraNayairvAvyairvaJcyate] (— is deceived by words falsely kind), Panc. 63 [snehasaMbhASaH] (a friendly discourse), Mhbh. 1, 152, 34 [sukhasuptAnvane bhrAtRRn…na bodhayiSyAmi] (I will not awake my brothers who are sleeping quietly in the forest), Kathâs. 42, 149 [paryAyAliGgitaH] (embraced by turns). In all but the first of these examples the former part is an <i>instrumentalis modi</span>, used almost as an adverb (77). Cp. the following paragraph.</p>

    <p>It would be indeed an interesting subject-matter for investigation to compare on a large scale these statements of Pâṇini with the facts offered us by tee extant Sanskrit literature.</p>
