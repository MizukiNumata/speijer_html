    <p>220. Comparison expressed by tatpurushas.</p>
    <p>The tatpurusha serves also to express comparison. Such compounds are partly adjectives, partly substantives. The former are of the type [ghanazyAma] (cloud-black), [indranIla] (sky-blue). The latter are made up of the thing’s real name + the image, under which it is represented, as [puruSavyAghraH], [rAjasiMhaH], [dordaNDaH], [karakisalayaH].</p>
    <p>Examples of the former type. Kâm. 3, 12 [jalAntazcandracapalaM jIvanam] (life I as fickle as the moon, that shines in the water), Daç. 174 [himazizira-] (as cold as ice), R. 3, 23, 1 [gardabhAruNaH] (red-grey as the colour of an ass), Mhbh. 1, 152, 2 [prAvRDjaladharazyAmaH] (as dark as a cloud in the rainy season), Mâlav. V, p. 122 [parighagurubhidorbhi], etc.</p>
    <p>The latter type is adapted to signify either praise or blame. Generally the metaphors used are conventional ones. In this way a resolute, energetic character is called [puruSasiMhaH], a beautiful face [sukhapadmam], [AnanAravindam] sim., eloquent speech [vAGmadhu], heavy sorrow is by a standing comparison [zokasAgaraH] which ocean it is difficult or impossible to pass, and so on. In ancient literature this rather allegorical style is still employed with moderation and within certain limits. But the flowery compositions of medieval India are full of them so as not rarely to make the image appear an appendix wholly meaningless, if not to please the ear of the reader and to display the vaidagdhya of the author. The accumulation of such allegorical designations becomes tedious indeed, unless good taste direct their employment.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the metaphor is worked out. Then we may have a set of homogeneous images, expressed by compounds. So Panc. I, 241 [gopAlena prajAdhenorvittadugdhaM zanaiH zanaiH / grAhyam], here [gopAla] is »king” but at the same time it conveys the meaning of „cow-herd,” as [go] is = „cow” and = »earth,” »he must draw the [vittadugdham] (money-milk) of his [prajAdhenoH] (subject-cow) by degrees” v. a. »a king must draw the money of his subjects by degrees, just as the cowherd draws the milk from his cow.” Mrcch. IV, p. 138 [iha sarvasvaphalinaH kulaputramahAdrumAH / niSphalatvamalaM yAnti vezyAvihagabhakSitAH] (young gentlemen often come to poverty, being spoiled by courtesans, like great trees, the fruits of which are eaten out by birds). Kathâs. 29, 188 a faithful wife is thus compared to a warrior — her conjugal faith is her chariot, duty her charioteer, good behaviour her armour, wit her weapon [bhartRbhaktirathArUDhAH zIlasaMnAharakSitAH /</p>
    <p>dharmasArathayaH sAdhvyo jayanti matihetayaH].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. According to vernacular grammar, this class of compounds is to be considered a subdivision of the karmadhârayas, there being sâmânâdhikaranya between both members. This explication cannot be right, for it does not account for the inverse order of the two members; one should f. i. expect [ratnastrI] instead of [strIratnam], as in the karmadhâraya the qualifying noun is of course put first. In fact, we have here no karmadhârayas, but shashtîsamâsas. The former member is a genitive, but it does not bear everywhere the same character. Sometimes it is a partitive one, as [puruSasiMhaH] = [puruSANAM (or puruSeSu) siMhaH], [rAjApasadaH], an outcast <i>among</span> the kings,” cp. the compounds in [uttama] (best) and [adhama] (worst, lowest). Sometimes, too, it is a genitive of the kind represented by our „a jewel of a woman,” »a bell of a fellow,” Lat. <i>scelus hominis</span>; so [gRhabhUtiH] (Mudr. III, p. 102) »a beauty of a house,” [sahAyasaMpat] (Mudr. III, p. 121) v. a. ,excellent helpers,” [bhAryAcelam] (P. 6, 2, 126) »a slut of a wife.” Not rarely both acceptations are alike probable; [strIratnam] f. i. may be as well = [strISu ratnam] »a jewel among women” as = »a jewel of a woman.”</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Pâṇini treats the said compounds severally, see 2, 1, 53; 56; 62; 66; 6, 2, 126 sq. — Note [-kITa] and [-apasada] expressing blame, and [-ratna], [-pAza], [-rUpa], signifying admiration.</p>
