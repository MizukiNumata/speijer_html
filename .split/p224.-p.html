    <p>Examples of bahuvrîhis. Type <i>a.</span>) Nala 1, 5 [tathaivAsIdvidarbheSu bhImo bhImaparAkramaH]. R. 3, 16, 11 [mRdusUryAH paTuzItAH…divasA bhAnti sAMpratam] (now the days are appearing with a mild sun, m11ch fog and a sharp cold). Hit. 90 [asau pApAzayaH] (he is of a wicked disposition). Panc. 150 [tena [sc. kroDena]…daMSTrAgreNa pATitodaraH pulindo gatAsurbhUtale ‘patat] (the Pulinda fell down <i>lifeless</span> on the earth, <i>having his belly split up</span> by the edge of the teeth of the boar). Mâlav. I, p. 14 [rAjA / anuvAcitalekhamamAtyaM vilobya] (as the minister <i>has finished his lecture of the letter</span>, the king looks on him). Panc. 71 [saMdahyamAnahRdayaH svayamevAbhyAgato vaktum] (<i>as it stung my mind</span>, I myself am come to tell you of it).</p>
    <p>Nothing impedes, of course, both the subject and the predicate being concordant substantives. Bhoj. 17 [rAjAnaH kozabalA eva vijayino nAnye] (no other kings are successful in their wars but those, whose power is a treasury), Panc. 185 [tatra vAyasarAjo’nekakAkaparivAraH prativasati sva] [the bahuvr. = yasyAneke kAkAH parivAraH »whose attendance are many crows”], Daç, 82 [aryavaryaH kuberadattanAmA] (a great merchant, whose name is Kub.), R. 3, 19, 22 [mAnuSau cIrakRSNAjinAmbarau].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. In such bahuvrîhis, as have an adjective behind, that adjective does duty of a subst. So f. i. Çâk. I [abhirUpabhUyiSThA pariSat] (the assembly is for the greater part made up of distinguished people) here the bahuvr. = [yasyA abhirUpA bhUyiSThAH] »most of which are [abhirUpAH],” Mâlat. I, p. 2 [uditabhUyiSTha eSa bhagavAntapanaH] »the sun has almost risen,” R. 2, 40, 17 [sItAtRtIyAnArUDhAndRSTvA] (— saw them mounted, having Sîtâ as the third), R. 3, 55, 15 [sahasramekaM mama kAryapuraHsaram] (thousand men whose <i>main object</span> [[puruHsaram]] it is to carry out my orders).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. A proper kind of bahuvrîhis are such as [asikara] (having a sword in one’s hand), [azrukaNTha] (sobbing, liter. »one having tears in his throat”) . In analyzing them, the latter part turns out a locative, for [asikaraH] = [yasyAsiH kare sa] and [azrukaNaThaH] = [yasyAzrUNi kaNThe sa]. For the rest, we have here no exception to the general rule on the arrangement of the two members of a bahuvrîhi. It is [asi] and [azru] which are predicated, not [kare] nor [kaNThe], for the intention is to say not that Mr. so and so has a hand or a throat, but what it is, he keeps within (*1). R. 3, 51, 9 Sîtâ has the epithet [bASpalocanA] »having tears in her eyes.” Comp. WHITNEY § 1303.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. In some bahuvrîhis the order of the members is optional. {P. 2, 3, 37.} One may say promiscuously [AhitAgniH] and [agnyAhitaH] (one who keeps the holy fires), [jAtaputraH] or [putrajAtaH] (one having children). Of the kind are [dantajAta] or [jAtadanta], see M. 5, 58 with Kull., [guDapriya] and [priyaguDa] (fond of sweetmeats) (*2), R. 2, 119, 5 [munayaH kalazodyatAH] (hermits with uplifted pitchers). Participles in [-ta] must be put behind, if the predicate be a weapon, therefore [asyudyataH] (with uplifted sword), see vârtt. on P. 2, 2, 36.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 4. The type a.) of the bahuvrîhi in its outer form is often identical with a karmadhâraya, for the discrepancies in the accentuation are not heeded. In practice, one avoids to use as bahuvrîhis such compounds as are wont to be karmadhârayas, as [sarvajana], [maharSi], [kalarava], and inversely such as [mahAbAhu], [bahuzruta], [kRtakArya] will not have to be otherwise accepted than as bahuvrîhis (*3). Yet, it often is only the context which will enable the reader how to accept a given compound.</p>

    <p>As to [priya], Pat. vârtt. 2 on P. 2, 2, 85 teaches the option. But it seems better to explain [guDapriya] as being a tatpursha, because 1st [priya] may be not only = »beloved.,” but also = »loving,” see Petr. Dict. IV, p. 1161 <i>s. v.</span> 1 c), 2ly as Pâṇini somewhere else [P. 6, 2, 15 sq.] mentions some <i>tatpurusha</span>, in [-prati]. The same may apply to some of the participles in [-ta], if not to all. Since [pIta] may sometimes have an active signification and sometimes a passive one, it is plain we are allowed to compound as well the tatpurusha [kSIrapItaH] = <i>lac potus</span>, as the bahuvr. [pItakSIraH] = <i>lacte poto</span>. Comp. what has been said p. 157 N. 2.</p>
    <p>Panc. 283 affords a specimen of a kind of compounds, in which two types are confounded: [kAcicchRgAlikA mAMsapiNDagRhItavadanA], here the author seems to have blended promiscuously two bahuvrîhis [mAMsapiNDavadanA] and [gRhItamAMsapiNDA], either of which would have sufficed.
