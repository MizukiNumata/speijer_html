    <p>226. Large bahuvrîhis.</p>
    <p>As bahuvrîhis of three and more members are excessively frequent, we will adduce some instances of them.</p>
    <p>1. the subject is a compound. Panc. 322 [tyaktAhArakriyaH] (abstaining from taking food) here the subject of the bahuvr. is [AhArakriyA], a tatpurusha; Vâr. Yog. 1, 8 [kSapitadhanarASTro bhavati] (he loses his wealth and his kingdom) here the subj. is a dvandva [dhanarASTre] »wealth and kingdom;” Daç. 78 a Jaina monk is thus qualified [prakIrNamalapaGkaH prabalakezaluJcanavyathaH prakRSTatamakSutpipAsAdiduHkhaH] (v. a. covered with dust and mud, enduring a heavy pain by pulling out his hair, suffering very much from hunger, thirst and the like) here the subjects of the three bahuvr. are respectively the dvandva [malapaGkau], the tatp. [kezaluJcanavyathA] and the tatp. [kSutpipAsAdiduHkham] and of them the two tatpurushas are themselves made up of more than two themes, as it is the compound [kezaluJcana] which qualifies [vyathA], and similarly the compound [kSutpipAsAdi], which is the cause of [duHkham].</p>
    <p>2. the predicate is a compound. — Instances of this category are very often met with, especially such bahuvrîhis as exhibit this type: qualifying noun-case + adjective or participle + substantive. Panc. 42 [taddhartA madavihvalAGgaH] = [madena vihvalAnyaGgAni yasya sa]; Kathâs. 72, 180 [prApArkasaMtaptasikatAM marubhUmim], here the bahuvr. is to be analyzed [arkeNa saMtaptAH sikatA yasyAM sA [marubhUmiH]]. But also other types, as: Mudr. III, p. 124 vultures ([mRdhrAH]) have the epithet[dIrghaniSkampapakSAH], here the analysis is [yeSAM dIrghA niSkampAzca pakSAH], the predicate, therefore, is an adjective-dvandva (208). Çâk. VII a curse is said to be [aGgulIyakadaezanAvasAnaH] = [yasyAGgulIyakasya darzanamavasAnaM sa zApaH].</p>
    <p>3. both subject and predicate are compounds, Kâd. I, p. 46 [tatra vasrabdhaviracitakulAyasahasrANi…zukazakunikulAni prativasanti sma] (crowds of parrots and [other] birds were dwelling there, building confidently thousand(s) of nests), here [visrabdhaviracita] is the predicate and [kulAyasahasra] the subject of the bahuvrlhi, the analysis of which is of course [yeSAM visrabdhaM viracitAni [-taM] kulAyAnAM sahasrANi [-srama]].</p>
