    <p>In the case of non-compound words, adjectives carrying the notion of <i>having</span>, <i>possessing</span>, as is taught in Sanskrit etymology, may be made by putting some derivative suffixe as [-mant], [-vant], [-maya], [-ita], [-in] etc. to the substantive, as [agrimant] (fiery), [putrin] (having a son) and the like. Of these suffixes, [-in] is very common(*1). Kathâs. 24, 9 [kirITI kuNDalI divyaH khaDgI cAvAtaratpumAn] (a divine person descended wearing a diadem, earrings and a sword), cp. R. 3, 50, 21. {P. 5, 2, 128.} They may also be put to dvandvas. Mhbh. 1, 126, 21 [jaTAjinI] (wearing tresses and a deer-skin), Pat. I, p. 1 [sAmsnAlAGgUlakakudakhuraviSANinAM saMpratyayo bhavati sa [go] zabdaH].</p>
    <p>Now, sometimes, these suffixes are added even then, if they are in no ways necessary for the understanding. So R. 3, 15, 11 [padmaiH surabhigandhibhiH…ramyA padminI] (a pond charming by its sweet scented lotuses), likewise Panc. 53 the weaver, who bas assumed the attributes of Vishṇu, is said to be [viSNucihnitaH] = [viSNozcihnairanvitaH], Bhoj. 2 a brabman is said [sakalavidyAcAturyavAn] = [sakalAya vidyAsucAturyeNa yuktaH]. In these cases no suffix was required, for the babuvrîhis [surabhigandha], [viSNucihna], [sakalavidyAcAturya] would be quite regular and plain. Compare Panc. I, 46 [suvarNapuSpitA pRthvI] = [suvarNapuSpA pRthvI]. This rather pleonastic idiom is especially used in some standing compounds. Grammarians teach and practice confirms [-in] being readily added to compounds in [-zobhA], [-zAlA], [-mAlA], [-dharma], [-zIla], [-varNa]. {P. 5, 2, 132.}</p>
