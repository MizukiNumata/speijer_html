    <p>230. Intricate compounds.</p>
    <p>Any Sanskrit compound belongs to one of the great classes mentioned before. Now, as not only the members of a compound but even their constituent elements may he compounds themselves, hence arises an almost unlimited freedom of enlarging compounds by taking up into them all sorts of nouns or adverbs serving to qualify the whole of the compound or part of it. In this way, very large and very intricate compounds are available, and in fact they often occur, albeit that the field of combinations and images is in some degree limited by conventional usage and by the examples of the best authors. For the rest the freqnency and the nature of those intricate and bulky compounds will much depend on the style of the literary work. It requires, therefore, a good deal of training to catch forthwith the purport of many an intricate compound.</p>
    <p>A few instances will suffice. Kâdamb. I, p. 15 the king, it is said, saw a lady <skt>kupitaharahutāśanadahyamānamadanadhūmamalinīkṛtāmiva ratim} »who was like Rati, stained by the smoke of Kâma burning by the fire of angry Çiva,” for when analyzing the complex, we get <skt>kupitasya harasya hutāśanena dahyamānasya madanasya yo dhūmo’bhūttena malinīkṛtām}, apparently a tatpurusha, the former member of which is also a tatpurusha the former member of which is also a tatp. and so on. Now a bahuvrîhi. In the same Kâd. (p. 39) a forest <skt>araṇyam} bears the epithet <skt>daśarathasutaniśitaśaranikaranipātanihatarajanīcarabalabahularudhirasiktamūlam} (where the roots [of the trees] had been moistened by the abundant blood of the army of the Râxasas killed by the shots of the crowd of sharp arrows [discharged] by the son of Daçaratha), here <skt>mūlam} is the subj. of the bahuvrîhi, the preceding complex being its predicate, an intricate tatpurusha, as it is thus to be analyzed <skt>daśarathasya sutasya niśitānāṃ śarāṇāṃ nikarasya nipātair yan nihataṃ rajanīcarāṇāṃ balaṃ tasya bahulena rudhireṇa siktam}. This whole clause is comprehended within one compound. And so often.</p>
