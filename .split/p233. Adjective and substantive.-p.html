    <p>233. Adjective and substantive.</p>

    <p>In ancient languages the difference between adjective and substantive is generally not so strongly marked as in modern ones. So especially in Sanskrit. Both classes of nouns have the same declension, and a great number of them have sometimes an adjectival meaning, sometimes they are substantives. They are only different as to their gender, substantives being nouns of one gender, but adjectives of three, as they must take the gender of the nouns they qualify (*1): <skt>śuklo varṇaḥ}, <skt>śuklā sudhā}, <skt>śuklaṃ vāsaḥ}.</p>
    <p>Adjectives proper, when used as substantives, may be distinguished thus:</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) the substantivizing results from the ellipsis of the concordant subst., as <skt>śītāḥ} [viz. <skt>āpaḥ}] „cold water,” <skt>palitāḥ} [viz. <skt>keśāḥ} „grey hairs;”</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) they are substantives when having got some special meaning, as <skt>tanu} adj. „thin,” subst. fem. „body;” <skt>hari} adj. „brown,” subst. masc. „lion; monkey; Indra; Vishṇu;”</p>
    <p><i>c.</span>) they are used as substantives while retaining their general signification, as <skt>priyaḥ} when meaning „a or the beloved one,” <skt>pāpaḥ} „a (the) wicked man.” The last category is the sole regarding us here, for any adjective may in this way tum substantive. The diversity of the endings for the different genders and numbers enables to express by one single word such phrases as „a rich man;” „a young woman,” „a business of weight,” resp. <skt>āḍhya}, <skt>taruṇo}, <skt>mahat}. The plural of course, if a plurality of things is meant; hence <skt>tāni} „that” when = those things, Lat. <i>ea</span>, <skt>bhadrāṇi} Lat. <i>fausta</span>, <skt>bahūni} <i>multa</span>, etc.</p>
    <p>Like other substantives, the substantivized adjectives may be an element in compounds. Hit. 94 <skt>hīnasevā na kartavyā kartavyo mahadāśrayaḥ} (one must not serve a weak [master], but join a mighty one), ibid. 102 <skt>alamanenātītopālambhena} (enough of this chiding the past).</p>

    <p>By this way we may account for the fact, that Indian grammar, full as it is of accurate and minute observations and of acute and sharp distinc­tions, does not possess proper terms expressive of categories of words as common and as indispensable to Western grammar as »adjective” and »substantive.” The <i>guṇavacana</span> of the vernacular grammarians encompasses more than our »adjective”; neither the <i>dravyâṇi</span> nor the <i>jâtayas</span> are the exact equivalent of our »substantives”. The term <i>viçeshaṇa</span>, used by</p>
    <p>Pâṇini himself, comprises both the apposition and the attributive adjective. The only term adopted to point out the adjective as such is <skt>nāma triliṅgam} »noun of three genders.”</p>
