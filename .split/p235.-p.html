    <p>Of the <<b>>nominal abstracts</span> the most important are those in <skt>-tā}, <skt>-tvā} and <skt>-bhāvaḥ}, as they may be derived of any noun. Of <skt>mṛdu} (weak) the abstract ,,weakness’’ is not only <skt>mārdavam} or <skt>mradimā} (see P. 5, 1, 122), but also <skt>mṛdutā}, <skt>mṛdutvam} and <skt>mṛdubhāvaḥ}. Nothing, too, impedes making them of compounds, as <skt>śreṣṭhyapatyatā} or <skt>-tvam} or <skt>-bhāvaḥ} ,,the being the child of <i>a set</span>’’ or <skt>caturmukhatvam} (<skt>-tā}, <skt>-tvam}) ,,the having four mouths’’ (*1). Hence the abstracts in <skt>-tā} and <skt>-tvam} and their synonyms are a fit means for expressing clauses and the like in a concise form, especially when attended by a subjective genitive. So <skt>devadattasya śreṣṭhyapatyatvam} = ,,the fact of N.N.’s being a merchant’s son,’’ <skt>brahmaṇaś caturmukhatā} ,,the four-facedness of Brahma.’’</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of this widely used idiom: Panc. I, 222 <skt>kanyāpitṛtvaṃ khalu nāma kaṣṭam} (it is a calamity to be father to a daughter); ibid. p. 71 <skt>dṛṣṭā mayāsya piṅgalakasya sārāsāratā} (I have scrutinized the good qualities of P. as well as his vices); Kumâras. I, 48: if animals felt shame, the female yaks, it is said, when seeing the beautiful hair of fair Umâ, would have abated their pride of their tails <skt>kuryurvālapriyatvaṃ śithilaṃ camaryaḥ}; Daç. 36 <skt>pravahaṇasya magnatayā sarveṣu nimagneṣu} (as all were drowned because of the ship’s foundering); Panc. 73 <skt>tvayāsya sakhitvāt sarvo’pi rājadharmaḥ parityaktaḥ} (by having him as your friend you have neglected the whole of your royal duty); Çâk. II: king Dushyanta, as his presence is wanted at different places at the same time, says <skt>kṛtyayor bhinnadeśatvād dvaidhobhavati me manaḥ}; Utt. II, p. 35 <skt>ghanavir alabhāvaḥ} »the density and the being scattered,” that is »the relative density,’’ Comment. on R. 3, 42, 10 <skt>pattananagarayorarājadhānorājadhānotvena bhedaḥ} (the difference between the words <i>pattana</span> and <i>nagara</span> is this that the former does not signify the king’s residence, the latter does). The last example shows also the fitness of this idiom for the sake of explaining and demonstrating. By grasping the different links of a sentence into one single word, scientific or philosophical matters may be treated in the very clearest and plainest manner, complex ideas being rendered by complexes of words, whereas the relation of the abstract noun with the other words of the sentence is sufficiently pointed out by its case-ending.</p>

    <p>The suffixes for making these abstracts are taught by Pâṇini 5, 1, 119-136. Those in <skt>-bhāva} are evidently tatpurushas, <skt>bhāva} meaning »the state, the being.’’ For this reason Pâṇini is right not mentioning them.</p>
