    <p>240. Adverbs.</p>
    <p>Sanskrit adverbs, as far as they are not old words of uncertain and forgotten origin — as <skt>muhuḥ}, <skt>drāk}, <skt>mṛṣā}, <skt>makṣu}, <skt>alam} and the like — are noun-cases either distinctly felt as such or in some degree petrified. The accusative of the neuter singular is as a rule employed, if adjectives be wanted to act as adverbs (*1) (55).</p>
    <p>Bahuvrîhis, like other adjectives, may do duty of adverbs, when put in the accus. of the neuter. Daç. 169 <skt>amuṃ ca…ātmanirviśeṣaṃ pupoṣa} (and he took no less care for him as for himself); Panc. 55 <skt>iti vadatyāṃ mātari rājaputrī bhayalajjānatānanaṃ} (as her mother spoke thus, the princess lowered her head for fear and shame and said); Çâk. I <skt>grīvābhaṅgābhir āmaṃ muhur anupatati syan dane dattadṛṣṭiḥ} ([the stag] runs on casting now and then a look on the chariot so as to cause to turn its neck ever so neatly); Âçv. Grhy. 1, 9, 1 <skt>pāṇigrahaṇādi gṛhyaṃ paricaret} here the first word is an adverb »from his marriage, beginning with his marriage.’’</p>
    <p>When derived from substantives, the adverbs are mostly modal instrumentals and ablatives (77, 104). Daç.136 <skt>smar asi kim adyāpy āyathātathyena mayoktapūrvam}, here <skt>āyathātathyena} = »falsely;’’ R. 3, 61, 20 <skt>nikhilena} »wholly’’. Likewise <skt>paryāyeṇa} »alternately,’’ <skt>lolayā} »jokingly,’’ etc., and ablatives, as <skt>haṭhāt}, <skt>svabhāvāt}.</p>

    <p>Adverbs are styled <skt>kriyāviśeṣaṇāni} »attributes of verbs.’’ The acc. neuter of an adjective, when used adverbially, is named <skt>karma kriyāviśeṣaṇam} see f. i. Kâç. on P. 2, 3, 33.</p>
