    <p>245. Superlative.</p>
    <p>The superlative expresses not only the „highest” but also a „very high” degree, just as in Latin and Greek. <skt>pāpiṣṭha} may be sometimes = <i>very bad</span>, sometimes = <i>the</span></p>
    <p><i>worst</span>. — When denoting the highest degree, there is generally some word added, as <skt>sarveṣām}, <skt>loke} etc. Mhbh. 1, 143, 3 = <skt>ayaṃ samājaḥ sumahān ramaṇoyatamo bhuvi} (this great assembly is the most pleasing on earth). But for the rest it signifies excellency among three or more, the comparative being destined for denoting it between two. Of two brothers one is the <skt>jyāyān}, the other <skt>kanīyān}, of more one the <skt>jyeṣṭhaḥ}, another the <skt>kaniṣṭhaḥ}.</p>
