    <p>246. Carelessness in their employment.</p>
    <p>Yet carelessness in the employment of comparative and superlative is not rare in Sanskrit. (*1) Sometimes the comparative is used instead of the superlative. Pat. I, p. 77 <skt>yathā tarhi bahuṣu putreṣv etad upapannaṃ bhavatyayaṃ me jyeṣṭhaḥ putro ‘yaṃ me madhyamo ‘yaṃ me kanīyān iti} — instead <skt>kaniṣṭhaḥ}. Panc. I, 408 it is said that of the shâdgunya the daṇḍa is the worst expedient, here we find <skt>pāpīyān}, not <skt>pāpiṣṭhaḥ}, ibid. p. 305 among four individuals one is said the <skt>jyeṣṭhataraḥ} (*2).</p>
    <p>Sometimes again the superlative is used instead of the comparative. Kathâs. 43, 23 of two brothers one calls himself <skt>kaniṣṭha}, and his brother <skt>jyeṣṭha}. Panc. 113 <skt>svāmy amātyayor ekatam asya vinipātaḥ} (a mischief of either king or minister). Cp. ibid. V, 36 <skt>vidyāyā buddhir uttamā} (judgment is better than learning), here the superl. is of necessity, as the comp. <skt>uttara} does not purport the meaning of excellency. For a different reason <skt>prathama} a superl. as to its form, is the equivalent of both »first’’ and »former.’’ So f. i. Mâlav. II, p. 35 <skt>atra bhavator ācāryayoḥ katarasya prathamaṃ prayogaṃ drakṣyāmaḥ} (of whom of these two honourable professors shall we see the performance the first ?)</p>

    <p>Further investigation will decide for how much of that seeming irregularity we are indebted to the faults and the sloth of copyists, and how much of it is really good Sanskrit.</p>
