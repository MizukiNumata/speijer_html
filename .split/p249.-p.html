    <p>Degrees of comparison may be made from undeclinable words; then they end in <skt>-tarām} and <skt>-tamām} as <skt>uccaistarām} (higher). Mâlav. II, p. 36 <skt>atitarām kāntam} (exceedingly charming), cp. P. 1, 2, 35.</p>

    <p>{ramayatitarām and the like.}</p>
    <p>Such comparison is made also of forms, belonging to the finite verb. {P. 5, 3, 56.} Instances of comparatives, made from the 3d person of the present not rarely occur in literature. R. 2, 64, 72 <skt>hṛdayaṃ sīdatetarām} (my spirits almlost lower). Prabodh. IV, p. 87 <skt>vināśo labdhasya vyathayatitarāṃ na tvanudayaḥ} (to lose something gained before grieves more than having gained nothing at all). Vikram. V, p. 178 <skt>prabhavatitarāṃ…bhujaṅgaśiśor viṣam} (even of an infant-snake the poison is rather strong). Ratn. III, p. 74 <skt>ramayatitarām} — Kathâs. 102, 35 we meet <skt>-tarām} put to a 3d person of the perfect: <skt>śraddadhetarām}.</p>
    <p>Instances of the superlative I do not recollect having met with, but they must be or have been not less allowed, as both degrees are equally taught by Pâṇini. (*1)</p>

    <p>WHITNEY § 473, al. 3 says that both compar. and superl. of verbal forms are »barbarous forms;’’ for what reason, I do not understand. Is it perhaps, because Kâlidâsa wrote barbarous Sanskrit, or because Pâṇini did not know well the idioms of his language?</p>
