    <p>25. vayam = aham or āvām</p>
    <p>The plural of the first person is allowed to be made use of, when meaning a singular or a dual. {P. 1, 2, 59.} Here we have not a majestic plural, but almost the same liberty as in Latin, to use <i>nos</span> = <i>ego</span>. Thus <skt>vayam} may have the purport of <skt>aham} and <skt>āvām}, and <skt>kurmaḥ} may be = <skt>karomi} or <skt>kurvaḥ}. Instances are very common. Mudr. I Câṇakya thus addresses his pupil <skt>vatsa kāryābhiyoga evāsmān ākulayati}, Panc. 41 a monk asks for hospitality with these words <skt>bho bhadra vayaṃ sūryoḍhā atithayas tavāntikaṃ prāptāḥ / na kam apy atra grāme jānīmaḥ} (*1). Similarly Panc. 58 the plural is used instead of the dual, <skt>kiṃ kurmaḥ sāṃpratam} (what shall we do now [you and I]?)</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>The given instance does not agree with the statement of some grammarian quoted by Pat. 1, 230 <skt>apara āha / asmadaḥ saviśeṣaṇasya prayoge na}. Pat. himself allows the plural of the first person even then, unless the proper name or the <i>yuvapratyaya</span> be added, thus <skt>ahaṃ devadattaḥ}, not <skt>vayaṃ}.</p>
