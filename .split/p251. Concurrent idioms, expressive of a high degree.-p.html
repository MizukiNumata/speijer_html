    <p>251. Concurrent idioms, expressive of a high degree.</p>
    <p>A high degree may be expressed also by several other idiomatic phrases, as:</p>
    <p>1. by <skt>-kalpa}(*1), <skt>-deśya}, <skt>-deśīya}, <skt>-prāya}, see 229, 5th in as much as they are a concurrent idiom of the comparative in one of its meanings:</p>
    <p>2. by putting <skt>bahu-} or <skt>parama-} before. Panc. I, 191 <skt>janāpavāde jagati bahucitre} (slander being rather manifold in the world); R. 3, 53, 1 <skt>janakātmajā duḥkhitā paramodvignā}; Mâlav. I, p. 10 some female is said to be <skt>paramanipuṇā medhāvinī ca}. Properly <skt>bahu-} means »tolerably, nearly” see P. 5, 3, 68, <skt>parama-} »exceedingly.”</p>
    <p>3. by such phrases as <skt>priyāt priyataram} (liter. »dearer than dear” = the very dearest), <skt>sukhāt sukhataram}; Mahâv. I, p. 21 <skt>priyāt priyataraṃ naḥ} (we are exceedingly rejoiced at it); Panc. 326 <skt>vegād vegataraṃ gacchati} (247).</p>
    <p>4. by putting the word twice, see 252.</p>
    <p>5, by adding <skt>-rūpa}, see 229, 6th.</p>

    <p><skt>pacati kalpam} and the like are among the examples of the commentaries on P. 5, 8, 67. Cp. 249.</p>
