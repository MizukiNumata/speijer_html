    <p>252. Putting a word twice.</p>
    <p>For different reasons <<b>>a word may be put twice</span>, <i>either</span> when put two times as a separate word, as <skt>śanaiḥ śanaiḥ}, <i>or</span> when making up some kind of compound, as <skt>puṭupuṭuḥ}(*1).</p>
    <p>1. Adjectives may be put twice, the two making but one word, in order to signify our ,,—like,’’ ,,rather.’’</p>
    <p>Daç. 149 <skt>kṣāmakṣāmāpi devatānubhāvād anatikṣīṇavarṇāvakāśā sīmantinī} (a woman, who though [of a] rather thin [aspect] had by divine power not too much lost of the brightness of her colour), R. 3, 67, 14 <skt>taṃ dīnadīnayā vācā…abhyabhāṣata}, Panc. II, 50 <skt>bhītabhītaḥ purā śatrur mandaṃ visarpati} (in the beginning a foe sneaks along very slowly, as one being rather afraid). So <skt>ekaika}, when = ,,alone,’’ and cp. such phrases, as <skt>pūrvaṃ pūrvaṃ puṣpyante}, <skt>prathamaṃ prathamaṃ pacyante} (they blossom—, they ripen the very first)(*1). Instances of adverbs put twice are not rare, as <skt>śanaiḥ śanaiḥ} (slowly, by degrees), <skt>muhur muhuḥ} (repeatedly), <skt>punaḥ punaḥ} (again and again), etc. Daç. 172 <skt>śālīn…mṛdu mṛdu gharṣayantī}.</p>
    <p>2. In the same way substantives, gerunds, participles when put twice, may indicate the non-interruption of some time or action. {P. 8, 1, 4.} R. 3, 10, 5 <skt>kālakāleṣu} (in uninterrupted time), Mâlav. IV, p. 105 <skt>pathi nayanayoḥ sthitvā sthitvā tirobhavati kṣaṇāt} (at the very moment she is standing on the path of my looks, she suddenly disappears), Daç. 95 <skt>ahaṃ rāgamañcaryāḥ…sānunayaṃ pāyitāyāḥ punaḥ punaḥ praṇayasamarpitamukham adhugaṇḍūṣam āsvādam āsvādaṃ madenāspṛśye}.</p>
    <p>3. Moreover, putting a word twice is also often a proper means for signifying a distributive sense (<i>vîpsâ</span>). {P. 8, 1, 4.} Instances of this idiom are frequent. Kâç. on P. 8. 1, 4 <skt>puruṣaḥ puruṣaḥ nidhanam upaiti} (every man is mortal), Panc. 42 <skt>pade pade praskhalan} (stumbling at every footstep), Daç. 99 <skt>ahar ahaś ca navanavāni prābhṛtāny upaharantī} (offering [her] always new presents day after day), ibid. 216 <skt>ṣaṇmāse ṣaṇmāse piccham ekaikaṃ parityajanti} (every sixth month they lose one single feather); R. 2, 91, 53 <skt>apy ekam ekaṃ puruṣaṃ pramadāḥ sapta cāṣṭa ca samāpetuḥ} (singulos viros septenae vel octonae mulieres appetierunt), Âpast. Dh. 1, 13, 18 <skt>saṃvatsare saṃvatsare dvau dvau māsī samāhita ācāryakule vaset}, M. 2, 20 <skt>svaṃ svaṃ caritraṃ śikṣeran} (they must learn every one his own duty). So <skt>diśi diśi} (in every region), <skt>ahar ahaḥ} (day after day) and so on. This idiom is as old as the Vaidik dialect. It is also used of gerunds. Pat. I, p. 44 <skt>maṇḍūkā utpnutyotpnutya gacchanti}.</p>
    <p>Here as a rule the case-endings of the former member remain.</p>

    <p>Pâṇini deals with this idiom at the commencement of his eighth adhyâya. (8, 1, 1-15). In interpreting sûtra. 9, the commentaries are wrong accepting it as teaching the formation of the word <skt>ekaika}. The sûtra <skt>ekaṃ bahuvrīhivat} cannot have this purport; its literal sense is »if a unity, [it is] bahuvrîhilike.” If Pâṇini had meant the <i>word</span> <skt>ekaika}, he would have written <skt>ekasya} not as he does <skt>ekam}; cp. the constant genitives in sûtra 5-8. Our sûtra refers to the cases, mentioned by s. 4-8. There the employment is taught of the »<i>two</span> (<skt>dve})” spoken of in 8, 1, 1. Sûtra 9 teaches, how these two are to be accepted, for it says: »[but these two may be] one; then the whole is <i>as if a bahuvrîhi</span>”, likewise in the case of s. 10. But from s. 11 the unity is <i>as if a karmadhâraya</span>. Pâṇini’s words in 9-11 are: <skt>ekaṃ bahuvrīhivat / ābādhe ca / karmadhārayavad uttareṣu}. From the conclusion of Kâç. on P.’s sûtra 9 I infer that the right interpretation had been proposed by somebody, but that it has been objected to by Patanjali. On the other hand, such forms with distributive sense as <skt>pūrvapūrvaḥ} being by necessity instances of the idiom, taught P. 8, 1, 4 afford some evidence for my own acceptation.</p>
