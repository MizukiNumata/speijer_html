    <p>254.</p>
    <p>Of a somewhat different nature is the type represented by R. 2, 12, 8 <skt>kiṃ kṛtaṃ tava rāmeṇa pāpe pāpam} (what <i>evil</span> has Râma done to you, <i>evil-minded woman?</span>); cp. the Greek <i>κακὸς κακῶς ἀπόλοιτο</span>. Here the inclination towards homophony is still more pronounced than in the idiom of 253. Compare Mhbh. 1, 145, 14 <skt>tāṃstathāvādinaḥ paurān duḥkhitān duḥkhakarśitaḥ / uvāca} (tristes tristis est allocutus oives); Kathâs. 38, 153 <skt>narasiṃhaḥ…taṃ…vṛtavān mitratvāya nṛpo nṛpam}.</p>
    <p>It is here not the place to expatiate upon this predilection of Sanskrit for bringing together words kindred in sound and playing with the different meanings inherent to them. Nearly all literary documents from the Vedas to our days afford the most ample evidence of it. For this reason, one must always be prepared to have to deal with riddles and the most various kinds of quibbles and puns. More information on this subject is to be given by works on Sanskrit rhetoric and Sanskrit literature.</p>
