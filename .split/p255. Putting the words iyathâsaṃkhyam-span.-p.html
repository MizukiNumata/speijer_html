    <p>255. Putting the words <i>yathâsaṃkhyam</span>.</p>
    <p>It may be of some use to mention here the figure yathâsaṃkhyam (*1), as it is employed not rarely and as its nature should be called rather grammatical than rhetorical. By it a series of substances named together with a series of attributes or predicates are so to be understood that the first substance is to be construed with the first predicate or attribute, the second with the second and so on successively. R. 3, 40, 12 <skt>agner indrasya somasya yamasya varuṇasya ca / auṣṇayaṃ tathā vikramaṃ ca saumyaṃ daṇḍaṃ prasannatām / dhārayanti mahātmāno rājānaḥ} (the kings possess the qualities of the five devas, Agni etc., viz. the glow [<i>aushnya</span>] of Agni, the strength [<i>vikrama</span>] of lndra, etc.), Âpast. Dh. 1, 5, 8 <skt>yatkiṃ ca manasā vācā cakṣuṣā vā saṃkalpayandhyāyatyāhābhivipśyati vā} = <skt>yatkiṃ ca manasā saṃkalpayandhyāyati vācā saṃ- āha cakṣuṣā vā saṃ- abhivipaśyati} (whatsoever he, desirous to accomplish it, thinks in his mind or pronounces in words or looks upon with his eye).</p>
