    <p>256. Personal pronouns.</p>
    <p>The personal pronouns are less used, than in English and many other modern tongues, as they are often not expressed, especially when implied by the personal endings of the verb (10). Nor are their oblique cases always wanted in Sanskrit, when undispensable in English. So in this sentence Hit. 24 <skt>tato dineṣu gacchatsu pakṣiśāvakān ākramya koṭaramānīya praty ahaṃ khādati}, the word <skt>pakṣiśāvakān} is at the same time object of <skt>ākramya}, of <skt>ānoya}, of <skt>khādati}; it is of course put once, but the pronouns referring to it are omitted as being easily supplied by the mind, whereas the English translator is bound to say „she [the cat] reached the young birds, took <i>them</span> to her hole and devoured <i>them</span>.’’ Cp. ibid. 96 <skt>bhagavantaṃ candramasaṃ praṇamya prasādya ca [sc. <skt>enam}] gaccha}, Mhbh. 1, 154, 30 <skt>niṣpiṣyainaṃ balād dhūmau paśum āramam ārayat}, where the pronoun <skt>enam} though being construed with two verbs is put but once, Daç. 152 <skt>ahaṃ ca tatra saṃnihitaḥ kiñcid asmeṣi(*1) saṃnidhiniṣaṇṇastu me vṛddhaviṭaḥ ko’pi brāhmaṇaḥ śanakaiḥ smitihetum apṛcchat}, sc. <skt>mām}, as is plain by the foregoing <skt>aham} and <skt>me}.</p>
    <p>Likewise the possessive pronouns may be omitted, if there can be no doubt as to the possessor, especially of course when referring to the subject. Hit. 7 <skt>tasya viṣṇuśarmaṇaḥ putrān [sc. <skt>svān}] samarpitavān}(*2).</p>

    <p>By a common error the printed text has <skt>asmaiṣi}.</p>

    <p>So was already taught by Patanjali (I, p. 62) <skt>mātari vartitavyaṃ pitari śuśrūṣitavyam iti / a cocyate svasyāṃ mātari svasminvā pitaroti saṃbandhāccaitadgamyate yā yasya mātā yaś ca yasya pitā}.</p>
