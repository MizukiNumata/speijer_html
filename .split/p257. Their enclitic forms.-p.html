    <p>257. Their enclitic forms.</p>
    <p><<b>>1st and 2nd person.</span> — The short forms of the acc., gen., dat. (*1) are enclitic, and used therefore if there is no stress to be laid on the pronoun. It is useless to give examples of them, as they are met with on almost every page. The acc. <skt>mā} and <skt>tvā} are however not so frequent as the other enclitic forms (*2).</p>
    <p>They are of necessity unavailable, if some emphasis of the pronoun be wanted. For this reason they are forbidden: <i>a</span>) when heading a sentence, or in poetry even a pâda, <i>b</span>) when immediately after a vocative, which heads the sentence, <i>c</span>) when followed by some particles, that give them some emphasis, viz. <skt>ca}, <skt>vā}, <skt>ha}, <skt>aha}, <skt>eva}. See P. 8, 1, 18; 20; 24; 72. Mhbh. 1, 229, 24 <skt>tvām ekam āhuḥ kavayas tvām āhus trividhiḥ punaḥ} [here <skt>tvā} would not be allowed]; Kâç. on 8, 1, 18 <skt>rudro viśveśvaro devo yuṣmākaṃ kuladevatā} [<skt>vaḥ} instead of <skt>yuṣmākam} cannot be, as it heads the pâda]; Hit. 110 <skt>rājāha / mantrin mamotsāhabhaṅgaṃ mā kṛyāḥ} [<skt>mama} not <skt>me}, according to <i>b</span>)]; R. 3, 55, 22 <skt>bhajasva sīte mām eva} (— none but me); Mâlav. I, p. 21 <skt>atra bhavataḥ kila mama ca [not: <skt>me ca}] samudrapalvalayor ivāntaram}.</p>

    <p>Epic poetry affords sundry instances pointing to the fact, that the abort forms of the gen. and dat. were once, it seems, available for all oblique cases. At least, R. 3, 43, 49 <skt>te} is doubtless = <skt>tvayā}, and Mhbh. 1, 230, 15 <skt>naḥ} = <skt>asmāsu}. The former passage runs thus <skt>apramattena te bhāvyamāśramasthena} (you must keep watchful in the hermitage), the latter <skt>mā tvaṃ…snehaṃ kārṣīḥ suteṣu naḥ}. Cp. <i>Vamana’s Stilregeln</span> eh. <i>Çabdaçuddhi</span>, s. 11.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>As <skt>mā} and <skt>māṃ}, <skt>tvā} and <skt>tvāṃ} are easily exposed to be confounded in manuscripts, it is possible that the enclitical forms have sometimes disappeared in our texts, if the following word commenced by a consonant. At all events, they seem to occur oftener in the ancient dialect than afterwards.</p>
