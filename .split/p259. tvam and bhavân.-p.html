    <p>259. tvam and bhavân.</p>
    <p>The pronoun of the 2nd person is used without respect to social relations; the singular <skt>tvam} is applied to superiors as well as to equals and to inferiors. The only case of <skt>yuvam} denoting a single individual is mentioned before (24).</p>
    <p>Yet, when addressing in a polite manner, one avails one’s self of <skt>bhavan} f. <skt>bhavatī}, plur. <skt>bhavantaḥ}, f. <skt>bhavatyaḥ} — being a popular reduction both in form and meaning of <skt>bhagavān} „Lord”. Like Spanish <i>Usted</span>, Italian <i>Ella</span>, <skt>bhavān} though being exponent of the second person, does agree with the 3rd person of the verb, therefore <skt>kiṃ karoti bhavān} (<skt>bhavatī}), when addressing one, <skt>kiṃ kurvanti bhavantaḥ} (<skt>bhavatyaḥ}), when addressing more (*1).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Both modes of expressing the 2d person, either by the pronoun <skt>tvam} or by the title <skt>bhavān} may be used promiscuously. It is very common to see them used alternately. Panc. 73 Damanaka says to the lion <skt>saṃjīvakaḥ śaṣpabhojī bhavān māṃ sādas tava prakṛtayaś ca} ([the bull] Sanj. is an herbivorous animal, but you [<skt>bhavān}] and your [<skt>tava}] subjects feed on flesh); Kathâs. 30, 17 <skt>gāndharvavidhinā] bhāryāṃ kuryād dhavān imām} (make her your wife by the Gândharva-rite, in this way she will become yours). In the first book of the Hitopadeça (p. 35 of B. K. Vidyâratna’s ed.) the sly cat thus addresses the blind vulture <skt>yuṣmān dharmajñānaratānviśvāsabhūmaya iti pakṣiṇaḥ sarve sarvadā mamāgre prastuvanti / ato bhavadbhyo vidyāvayovṛddhebhyo dharmaṃ śrotum ihāgataḥ} [<skt>aham}], as to the plural <skt>yuṣmān}, <skt>bhavadbhyaḥ} see 24.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Instances of <skt>bhavān} construed with the 2nd person of the verb are extremely rare and the idiom undoubtedly vicious. So Çânkh. Grhy. 2, 2, 8 <skt>brahmacāro bhavān brūhi}, instead of <skt>bravītu} or <skt>brūtām} »say, you are a <i>brahmacârin</span>.”</p>
