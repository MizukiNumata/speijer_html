    <p>26. Dual.</p>
    <p>In all periods of the language the <<b>>dual</span> is the proper and sole number by which duality is to be expressed. {P. 1, 4, 21 sq.}</p>
    <p>If the voluminous mass of Sanskrit literature will once be thoroughly examined with respect to syntactic facts, it is not improbable there will be put forward sundry instances of duality expressed by the plural number. But the number of such exceptions cannot be but exceedingly small (*l). For, though the vulgar dialects and the pali have lost the dual, polished Sanskrit always strictly observes its employment and does in no way offer that confusion of dual and plural, which is so obvious in Attic Greek and already in the dialect of Homer.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>I have noticed three instances, all of them in poetry, and partly fit methinks to be interpreted so as to confirm the general role. Of them, one R. 2, 22, 23 <skt>ṛṣayo’pi bhraśyante kāmamanyubhiḥ} contains a plural, which may be accounted for as denoting either the various kinds of <i>studium</span> and <i>ira</span> (cp. Manu 7, 45-48) or as pointing at the diversity in time, space and persons of the manifold instances of holiness lost, so the comm. <skt>bahuvacanaṃ vyaktibahutvāt}. — Kathâs. 107, 51 <skt>śvaśrūśvaśurāṇām} the majestic plural seems to have been employed. Strange is this passage: Mhbh. 1, 24, 6 <skt>candrādityair yadā rāhur ākhyāto hy amṛtaṃ piban}, there being no room for the scholiast’s interpretation <skt>ādityasya mūrtibahutvena candrādityair iti bahuvacanam}.</p>
