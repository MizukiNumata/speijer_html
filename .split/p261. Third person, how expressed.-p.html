    <p>For the <b>third person</span> Sanskrit does not possess a proper personal pronoun, like our <i>he, she, it</span>. Its duties are discharged by demonstratives. When wanted to be emphasized, by <skt>sa}, <skt>ayam}, <skt>asau}, otherwise by the oblique cases derived from the pronominal roots <skt>a}, <skt>ana}, <skt>ena}, or what is practically the same, in the acc. by <skt>enam}, <skt>enām}, <skt>enat}, plur. <skt>enān}, <skt>enāḥ}, <skt>enāni}, in the other cases by the forms belonging to <skt>ayam}. The nomin. is not expressed but with some emphasis. See 274.</p>
