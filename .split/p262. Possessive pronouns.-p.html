    <p>262. Possessive pronouns.</p>
    <p>The <<b>>possessive pronouns</span> are relatively less used than the genitives of the personal ones. One will oftener meet with <skt>mama sūnuḥ}, <skt>sūnur me} or <skt>matsūnuḥ} (a <i>shasthîsamâsa</span> 216, 1°) than <skt>sūnur madīyaḥ}.</p>
    <p>The difference, which exists in English between <i>my</span> and <i>mine</span>, <i>your</span> and <i>yours</span> etc., is not known in Sanskrit; <skt>madīyaṃ} or <skt>mama pustakam} may be as well „my book’’ as „a book of mine;’’ also „the book is mine;’’ <skt>matpustakam} of course cannot have the last meaning, for subject and predicate are by necessity unfit for being compounded.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Apart from the regular possessives of the 2nd person <skt>tvadīya} and <skt>yuṣmadīya}, there exists also <skt>bhavadīya} derived from the polite <skt>bhavān}. Panc. 168 <skt>bhavadīya sāhasenāhaṃ tuṣṭaḥ} [ = <skt>bhavataḥ sāha-} or <skt>bhavatsāha-}].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. The possessive of the 3rd person is <skt>tadīya} (if wanted <skt>etadīya}), but here too the genitive of the demonstrative or a <i>shashthîsamâsa</span> are generally preferred.</p>
