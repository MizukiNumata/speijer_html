    <p>263. Reflexes.</p>
    <p>The <<b>>reflexive pronouns</span> <skt>sva} and <skt>ātman} refer to all persons. — 1. <skt>ātmā}, acc. <skt>ātmānam}, instr. <skt>ātmanā} etc. is the proper equivalent of English <i>myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, one’s self; ourselves, yourselves, themselves</span>. It is always a masculine and a singular, even when referring to a plural or a not-masculine. Properly it is a subst. meaning »soul, spirit, individuality’’ and in this meaning it has always remained in common use. But even when pronoun, its origin is more or less perceptible. Occasionally it may be rendered as well by a pronoun as by a subst. (*1).</p>
    <p>2. <skt>sva} generally — though not always — does duty of a possessive; it does denote the subject being possessor and may be rendered, according to sense, by <i>my, your, his, her, our, their</span>. Often it is compounded with its noun.</p>
