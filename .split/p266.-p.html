    <p>As a third reflexive we may consider <skt>nija} „own,’’ as it may not rarely be rendered by the possessive pronoun. Panc. 56 the king says to his daughter <skt>saṃbodhyo ‘dya tvayā nijabhartā yathā mama śatrūn vyāpādayati} (you must to day exhort your husband, that he may destroy my enemies). Inversely <skt>sva} may also be = »own:’’ Kathâs. 39, 53 <skt>svasukhaṃ nāsti sādhvīnāṃ tāsāṃ bhartṛsukhaṃ sukham}.</p>
