    <p>269. Reciprocal pronouns: anyonya etc.</p>
    <p>The <b>reciprocal pronouns</span> <skt>anyonya}, <skt>paraspara}, <skt>itaretara} have almost assumed the character of adverbs. As a rule, they are used in the acc. of the masc. <skt>anyonyam} etc. while being applied to every gender and every case-relation. Çâk. I <skt>ubhe [sakhyau] parasparam avalokayataḥ} (the two friends look at each other); Vikram. I, p. 18 <skt>anyonyaṃ hastaṃ spṛśataḥ} (they shake hands); Panc. 216 <skt>evaṃ ca parasparaṃ dvaidham utpannam} (and in this manner discord arose between them); Daç. 151 <skt>ubhau…trapayā sādhvasena vānyonyam ātmānaṃ na vivṛṇvāte} (both, either by shame or by confusion, do not open their soul to each other); Çank. on Ch. Up. p. 42 <skt>samānam itaretaraṃ pāṇādityau} (the principle of life and the sun are identical to one another); Pat. I, p. 426 <skt>sārthikānām ekapratiśraya uṣitānaṃ prātarutthāya pratiṣṭhamānānāṃ kaścit parasparaṃ saṃbandho bhavati}. Cp. also Kâm. 2, 42; Mâlav. I, p. 24; Kathâs. 2, 41 etc.</p>
    <p>Yet they admit also of other case-endings, f. i. Panc. III, 200 <skt>parasparasya marmāṇi ye na rakṣanti jantavaḥ} (they who do not observe the weak points of each other); Harshac. 2 <skt>teṣām anyonyasya vivādāḥ prādurabhūvan} (disputations arose between them). So Nala. 5, 32 <skt>tau parasparataḥ prītau}. Nala. 1; 16 the acc. <skt>anyonyam} is depending on the prep. <skt>prati}. And so on. See Kâç. on P. 8, 1, 12 vârtt. 9 and 10; vârtt. 10 teaches the optional employment of forms in <skt>-ām}, if feminine and neuter words are concerned f. i. <skt>itaretarām [or -ram] ime brāhmaṇakule — ime brāhmaṇayau — bhojayataḥ}.</p>
    <p>The same meaning is carried by the adverb <skt>mithaḥ} (mutually), which is not less used.</p>
