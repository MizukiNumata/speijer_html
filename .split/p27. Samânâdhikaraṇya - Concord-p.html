    <p>27. Samânâdhikaraṇya / Concord</p>
    <p>II — Concord in case, number, gender and person is in Sanskrit the same, as in all languages with inflections, that is to say, it does exist between all such words, as, while standing in the same sentence, are to point at the same thing. For this reason, the <i>predicate</span> does agree with its subject in case and person, the <i>attribute</span> with the noun, it qualifies, in case and — if possible — also in number and gender, and so on. It would be superfluous to exemplify this general rule (*1), which, moreover, is common to all languages. It will suffice to notice some more or less remarkable features:</p>

    <p>1) Pronouns follow the general rules of agreement. Thus it is Sanskrit to say <skt>sa praśnaḥ}, as it is Latin to say <i>haec est quaestio</span>, whereas Teutonic dialects always put the pronoun in the neuter sing. Dutch <i>dat is de vraag</span>, Germ. <i>das ist die Frage</span>. Panc. 63 <skt>mama prāṇayātreyam} (so is my livelihood), ibid. II, 201 <skt>asau praramau hi mantraḥ} (that is the most important counsel), Çak, VII <skt>sidhyanti karmasu mahatsvapi yan niyojyāḥ saṃbhāvanāguṇamavehi tam īśvarāṇām} (if officers are successful in weighty affairs, impute it to the virtue of their masters, who honour them with the execution). — Yet there may occur instances, where it would be not possible to observe this rule (*2).</p>

    <p>2) Occasionally the verb will agree with the noun-predicate when standing near, instead of agreeing with the subject. Panc. 263 <skt>sarpa āha / sāmprataṃ tvaṃ me mitraṃ jātam} [not <skt>jātaḥ}], M. 9, 294 <skt>sapta prakṛtayo hy etāḥ saptāṅgaṃ rājyam ucyate} (these [foresaid] seven elements are named together the seven-membered kingdom), ibid. 2, 81 <skt>mahāvyāhṛtayaḥ…tripadā caiva sāvitrī vijñeyaṃ brahmaṇo mukham}<i> </span>(— and the three-membered <i>sâvitrî</span> should be considered as the mouth of <i>brahma</span>).</p>

    <p>3) Sometimes, in cases of discordance between the grammatical and the real gender or number of à noun, its predicate or attribute will agree with the latter (<<b>>constructio ad synesin</span>) R. 2, 52, 42 <skt>tvāṃ cintayantaḥ — nirāhārāḥ kṛtāḥ prajāḥ} (thinking of thee — the subjects do not take food); here to <skt>prajāḥ}, though grammatically a fem., is added a participle in the mascul. Note in the example quoted the distance by which the attribute is separated from the noun, it qualifies.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Grammatical concord bears with vernacular grammarians the well-chosen name of <i>sâmânâdhikaraṇya</span>, that is »the relation existing between <i>sâmânâdhikaraṇâs</span> or words, whose substrate (<skt>adhikaraṇa}) is the same (<skt>samāna})”.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>See for inst. Ch. Up. 6, 16, 2 <skt>etadātmyam idaṃ sarvaṃ tatsatyaṃ sa ātmā tat tvam asi śvetaketo}. Here <skt>sa ātmā} is rendered by Prof. Max Müller »it is the Self,” in a note to subjoins: »The change of gender in <i>sa</span> for <i>tad</span> is idiomatic. One could not say in Sanskrit <i>tad âtmâ</span> it is the Self, but <i>sa âtmâ</span>.’’ (Pref. to the Sacr. Books of the East, I, p. XXXVI). Nevertheless, in the words immediately following <skt>tat tvam asi}, that very idiom seems to be neglected, for the neuter <skt>tat} is the predicate of the masc. <skt>tvam}. Here the neuter has been preferred, because of <i>tad</span> and <i>tvam</span> there is not affirmed a full identity, as it is done with respect to <i>sa</span> and <i>âtmâ</span>, but it is only said, <i>tvam</span> is a phenomenal manifestation of <i>tad</span>: »<i>tad</span> (sc. âtmà) is also in you.”</p>
