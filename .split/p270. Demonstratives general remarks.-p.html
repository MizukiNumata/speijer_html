    <p>270. Demonstratives: general remarks.</p>
    <p>In ancient language the <b>demonstratives</span> are often indicating the things they are to point at in a more significant manner than in modern tongues. For this reason, when translating from the Sanskrit, it is many times indispensable to render demonstrative pronouns otherwise, f. i. by the pronoun <i>he, she, it</span>, by the, by adverbs (<i>here, there</span>), sometimes even by putting instead of them the very noun, they are referring to. In the</p>
    <p>same way, indeed, the demonstratives of Latin and Greek must be translated.</p>
    <p>We will dispense here with adducing instances exemplifying each of the somewhat freer translations, as have been named. It will suffice giving a few samples of Sanskrit demonstr. pronouns to be rendered by English adverbs. Panc. 204 <skt>bho bho kapiñcala eṣa nadītīre tapasvī dharmavādī tiṣṭhati} (say, woodcock, <i>here</span> on the riverside a holy devotee stands); Vikr. I, p. 15 the king says to his charioteer <skt>sūta idaṃ tacchailaśikharam} (— <i>here</span> is that mountain-top); Çâk. IV KaNva asks »where are Çârngarava and Çâradvata,’’ they answer <skt>bhagavannimī svaḥ} (Reverend, here we are). From the Vaidik writings I add Ath. V. 1, 29, 5 <skt>udasau sūryā agādud idaṃ māmakaṃ vacaḥ} (there the sun has risen and <i>here</span> bas my spell).</p>
