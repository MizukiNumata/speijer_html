    <p>271. Difference of employment between them.</p>
    <p>Of the four demonstratives, used in classic Sanskrit, <skt>ayam} and <skt>eṣa} are opposite to <skt>sa} and <skt>asau}. Their different nature is well described by a vernacular grammarian, when pronouncing that <skt>eṣa} is expressive of <i>nearness</span> but <skt>asau} of <i>remoteness</span>, and that <skt>ayam} implies <i>presence</span> but <skt>sa} <i>absence</span> (*1). Indeed, both <skt>eṣa} and <skt>ayam} point at something near to the speaker or his time, whereas <skt>asau} and <skt>sa} indicate something remote either by space or by time. Therefore, the latter couple may he compared to Lat. <i>ille</span> and <i>iste</span>, Gr. <i>ἐκεῖνος</span>, Engl. <i>that</span>, the former to Lat. <i>hic</span>, Greek <i>οὗτος</span>, and <i>ὅδε</span>, Engl. <i>this</span>.</p>
    <p>The difference between them will appear better when perusing Sanskrit texts, than from instances detached from the context they are taken out. Yet, here are several, which may give some idea of it.</p>
    <p>1. <skt>eṣa} and <skt>ayam}. — Vikram. I, p. 14 Purûravas points with his hand to Urvaçî her attendance: <skt>etāḥ} says he <skt>sutanu sukhaṃ te sakhyaḥ paśyanti} (Lat. <i>hae amicae</span> —); Nala. 3, 4 Indra declares to Nala the name of himself and his comrades: <skt>aham indro ‘yam agniś ca tathaivāyam apāṃ patiḥ / …yamo ‘yam api pārthiva} (Lat. <i>ego lndrus, hic Agnis</span> etc.).</p>
    <p>2. <skt>asau} and <skt>sa}. — Nala. 3, 2 Nala asks the devas, for what purpose they wish him to be their messenger <skt>kaścāsau yasyāhaṃ dṛta īpsitaḥ / kiṃ ca tadvo mayā kāryam}, here both <skt>asau} and <skt>tat} answer to Latin <i>iste</span>; — Mudr. II, p. 77 the minister Râxasa, when hearing from his spy that the physician, whom he had despatched to empoison king Candragupta, had been prevented from performing that plot by the vigilance of Câṇakya, exclaims <skt>śaṭhaḥ khalv asau baṭuḥ / atha sa vaidyaḥ katham}, here both <skt>asau} and <skt>sa} are = Lat. <i>ille</span>.</p>
    <p>3. Examples of <i>this</span> and <i>that</span> in opposition to one another. — Ch. Up. 2, 9, 1 <skt>amumādityam upāsīta…tasminnimāni sarvāṇi bhūtān yan vāyattāni} (let him meditate on <i>that</span> sun..... it is on <i>that</span> all <i>these</span> beings [here on earth] are depending upon), ibid. 1, 3, 2 <skt>samāna u evāyaṃ cāsau coṣṇo ‘yam uṣṇo ‘sau} (this breath here and that sun there are indeed the same, this is hot and that is hot); Utt. II, p. 27 <skt>ayam asāv adhyayan avighnaḥ} <i>hoc illud studiorum impedimentum</span> »that well-known hindrance now presents itself.’’ — In the first act of the Mudrarâxasa the minister Câṇakya, after having put the jeweller Candanadâsa into prison, thus expresses his contentment: <skt>hanta labdha idānīṃ rākṣasaḥ / kutaḥ}.</p>
    <p><skt></p>
    <p>tyajatyapriyavatprāṇān yathā tasyāyam āpadi</p>
    <p>tathaivāsyāpadi prāṇā nūnaṃ tasyāpi na priyāḥ</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p><skt>tasya} refers to Râxasa, <skt>ayam} and <skt>asya} to Candanadâsa. In Latin one would say likewise: ut <i>hic</span> in <i>illius</span> re adversa suae vitae jacturam facit, sic profecto et <i>ille</span> vitam pro nihilo putabit in <i>hujus</span> calamitate. — In the Vikramorvaçî king Purûravas designates his beloved Urvaçî by the pronoun <skt>ayam}, as long as he knows her present and sees her (1st act), but in the second act, when thinking her absent, be speaks of <skt>tasyā āsanam}, expresses his disappointment about her female attendant coming <skt>sakhyā virahitā tayā}, and says on account of her <skt>paryutsukāṃ kathayasi priyadarśanāṃ tām / ārtiṃ na paśyasi purūravas astadarthām} — whereas in the first act, when looking at her face, be admires <skt>idaṃ rūpam}, exclaims <skt>neyaṃ tapasvinaḥ sṛṣṭiḥ}, is uneasy, as <skt>asyā bhayakampaḥ} is noticed by him.</p>
