    <p>275. The pronoun sa and its employment.</p>
    <p><skt>sa} likewise points at somebody or something known, and therefore, like <skt>ayam}, it is fit for doing duty of the pronoun <i>he, she, it</span>. Yet, they are not synonymous. Like Greek, especially Homeric, <i>ὁ, ἡ, τό</span>, it signifies, that the person or thing referred to is well-known, or has</p>
    <p>been named just before, or will be named forthwith. It is therefore never an enclitic, and is sometimes = Lat. <i>ille</span>, sometimes = <i>is</span> ,,the afore said.’’ Hence its fitness to be rendered by ,,the.’’ When referring to the relative <skt>ya}, it may be equivalent to ,,he,’’ German <i>derjenige</span>. It is also used to indicate the changing of the subject, f. i. <skt>sa āha} or <skt>so ‘py āha} = ,,the other said, answered.’’ Yet it may as well point at the same throughout a succession of sentences, in which case one is inclined to put it at</p>
    <p>the head, as Daç. 12 <skt>vāmadevanāmānaṃ tapodhanaṃ jagāma / taṃ praṇamya tena kṛtātithyas tasmai kayitakṛtyas tadāśrame…kaṃcit kālam uṣitvā…munimabhāṣata}; Nala 1, 5 Bhîma king of Vidarbha has been named, it follows <skt>sa prajārthe paraṃ yatnam akarot…tam abhyagacchat brahmarṣirdamano nāma…taṃ [viś. damanaṃ] sa bhīmaḥ [the aforesaid Bh.] prajākāmastoṣayāmāsa…tasmai prasanno damano varaṃ dadau}. Cp. also the examples adduced 271, 3°.</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. of <skt>sa} = <i>ille</span> (the well-known, the famous). Çâk. VII <skt>tatkoṭimatkuntiśamābharaṇaṃ maghonaḥ} (the <i>renowned</span> thunderbolt, Indra’s attribute, Lat. <i>fulmen illud Jovis</span>).</p>
    <p>2. <skt>sa} = »the afore said.’’ Çâk. IV Kanva says to Çakuntalâ <skt>yayāter iva śarmiṣṭhā bhartur bahumatā bhava / sutaṃ tvam api saṃrājaṃ seva pūrum avāpnuh}, here <skt>seva} ,,as she’’ means of course Çarmishthâ.; Kathâs. 27, 109 <skt>upādhyāyasya kasyacit / brāhmaṇasyābhavan śiṣyāḥ sapta brāhmaṇaputrakāḥ / (110) sa tān śiṣyānupādhyāyo dhenuṃ durbhikṣadoṣataḥ / gomataḥ śvaśurādekāṃ yācituṃ prāhiṇottataḥ / (111) te ca gatvānyadeśasthaṃ durbhikṣakṣāmukukṣayaḥ / taṃ tadgirā tac chvaśuraṃ tac chiṣyā gāṃ yayācire / (112) so ‘pi vṛttikarīmekāṃ dhenuṃ tebhyaḥ samarpayat} (some teacher of the brâhmana class had seven disciples, brâhmanas they too. Once because of famine he despatched these disciples to beg one cow from his father-in-law, who was rich in cows. They set out, suffering much from hunger, to the foreign country, where dwelled that man, and begged a cow of the father-in-law of their teacher, in his name. The father-in-law gave them one, fit to procure [them] a livelihood). Here we have several instances of <skt>sa} referring to something mentioned before, and even such accumulation as in vs. 111 <skt>te…taṃ tadgirā} etc., <skt>te} pointing at the disciples, <skt>taṃ} at the father-in-law, <skt>tat-} at the teacher. It is, indeed, always allowed to employ <skt>sa} many times in the same sentence, though pointing at different persons or things, f. i. Mhbh. 1, 2, 395 <skt>yo gośataṃ kanakaśṛṅgam ayaṃ dadāti / viprāya vedaviduṣe ca bahuśrutāya / paṇyāṃ ca bhāratakathāṃ śṛṇuyāc ca nityam / tulyaṃ phalaṃ bhavati tasya ca tasya caiva}, the last words mean: »of the one as well as of the other.’’</p>
    <p>3. <skt>sa} when adj. = »the.’’ R. 3, 35, 27 a tall fig-tree is described, whose branches are of enormous size: <skt>tatrāpaśyat…nyagrodham…samantādyasya tāḥ śākhāḥ [»<i>the</span> branches of which]’’ śatayojanamāyatāḥ}; Utt. II, p. 29 one asks <skt>atha sa rājā kimācāraḥ saṃprati} (but what is <i>the</span> king doing now ?) another answers <skt>tena rājñā kraturaśvasedha prakrāntaḥ} (<i>the</span> king has commenced an açvamedha).</p>
    <p>4. <skt>sa} in correlation with <skt>ya} = Germ. <i>derjenige</span>. Mhbh. 1, 74, 40 <skt>sā bhāryā yā gṛhe dakṣā sā bhāryā yā prajāvato}. Generally the relative clause precedes, see 452, 2nd and 455.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Now and then <skt>sa} refers to persons or things not expressed, but only implied by the foregoing. Mhbh. 11 adhy. 157 it is told, that Kuntî and her strong son Bhîmasena hear cries of distress in the house of the worthy brahman, whose hospitality they are enjoying of. Though the family of the brahman has not been named in the foregoing, vs. 10 introduces them by the pronoun <skt>tān}. The same idiom exists in Latin.</p>
