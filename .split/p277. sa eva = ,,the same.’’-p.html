    <p>Panc, 172 <skt>tāveva dvo puruṣo miyo mantrayataḥ} (<i>the same</span> two men keep counsel together); ibid. V, 26 <skt>tānīndriyāṇy avikalāni tadeva nāma / sā buddhir apratihatā vacanaṃ tadeva // arthoṣmaṇā virahitaḥ puruṣaḥ sa eva / bāhyaḥ kṣaṇena bhavatīti vicitram etat} (his senses are the same, without defect; his name is the same; his is the same vigour of mind, the same speech; yet — how curious it is — the self-same man, when having lost the splendour of his wealth, becomes forthwith a stranger). The latter example shows, that if <skt>sa} is plainly conveying the meaning »the same,” <skt>eva} may be omitted, cp. Ch. Up. 5, 4, 2 <skt>tasminn etasminn agnau}.</p>
