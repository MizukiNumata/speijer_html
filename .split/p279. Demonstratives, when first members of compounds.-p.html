    <p>279. Demonstratives, when first members of compounds.</p>
    <p>Some other observations on the demonstratives. —</p>
    <p>1. In compounds, <skt>tat} and <skt>etat} are considered as the themes, which represent <skt>sa} and <skt>eṣa}; likewise <skt>mat}, <skt>tvat}, <skt>asmat}, <skt>yuṣmat} (*1) are respectively the thematic shapes of <skt>aham}, <skt>tvam}, <skt>vayam}, <skt>yūyam}. — <skt>ayam} and <skt>asau} are seldom used in compounds, if they are, the neuter (<skt>idam}, <skt>adaḥ}) is employed. But, as a rule, <skt>etat} and <skt>tat} are substituted for them. In other terms: in compounds, <skt>etat} has the meaning of Lat. <i>hic</span> and <skt>tat} that of Lat. <i>is</span> or <i>ille</span>. Mrcch. I, p. 3 the director informs the public <skt>yadidaṃ vayaṃ mṛcchakaṭikaṃ nāma prakaraṇaṃ prayoktuṃ vyavasitāḥ…etatkaviḥ} etc., while speaking of the poet of the piece he has named. Kathâs. 64, 25 <skt>avāryata pānthena tadvadhāt} (he was prevented from injuring them by a passer-by), here <skt>tadvadhāt} refers to <skt>amībhiḥ…lomaśaiḥ} [sc. <skt>tāpasaiḥ}] in vs. 24.</p>

    <p>{Idiom: <i>is pavor</span> = <i>ejus rei pavor</span>.}</p>
    <p>2. The idiom I represented by Latin <i>is pavor</span> = <i>ejus rei pavor</span> (*2) is not unknown in Sanskrit. Mhbh. 1, 6, 11 Agni says <skt>bibheti ko na śāpānme kasya cāyaṃ vyatikramaḥ}, here <skt>ayaṃ vyatikramaḥ} = <skt>asya [śāpasya] vyati-} (who is not afraid of my curse, who has an escape from it ?). Panc. 158 a boy has been turned out of doors by his father <skt>gṛhānniḥsāritaḥ}. The author proceeds <skt>sa ca tena nirvedena deśāntaraṃ gatvā}, apparently <skt>tena nirvedena} is here = <skt>tasya [niḥsāraṇasya] nirvedena} »by despair caused by this expulsion’’. Cp. Kumâras. 3, 17, Kathâs. 1, 39.</p>

    <p>{asau in formulae.}</p>
    <p>3. In formulae one uses <skt>asau} as significative of the proper name of him, whom the formula is to be applied to. When employing them, the proper name is substituted for it. See f. i. Pâr. Grhy. 1, 18, 3 <skt>asau jīva śaradaḥ śatam}. Âçv. Grhy. 1, 20, 5.</p>

    <p>{neuters of demonstratives, used as adverbs.}</p>
    <p>4. In the archaic dialect, especially in the liturgical books, the acc. of the neuter singular of demonstratives is often used adverbially. Ait. Br. 1, 9, 6 <skt>sarvair vai chandobhir iṣṭvā devāḥ svargaṃ lokamajayaṃstathaivaitad yajamānaḥ…svargaṃ lokaṃ jayati}, here <skt>etat} means »in this case.’’ Cp. ibid. 1, 4, 2; 1, 15, 4, Ch. Up. 4, 2, 1 <skt>tadu} = ,,then,’’ etc. etc. The classic language has retained adverbial functions of <skt>tat} and <skt>yat}, see 444 and 483.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>By this orthography here and elsewhere I follow the rules of Sanskrit euphony; etymological reasons would rather require to write <skt>tad}, <skt>etad} etc.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>See f. i. Livy 21, 46, 7 Numidae a.b tergo se ostenderunt. Is pavor perculit Romanos. Cp. Virg. <i>Aen</span>. 1, 261, Nepos Lys. 3, 1.</p>
