    <p>If the same predicate belongs to more subjects or the same attribute refers to more nouns at the same time, the idiom of Sanskrit is almost like that of other languages.</p>
    <p><i>Either</span> the common predicate (attribute) agrees with but one and must be supplied mentally with the others, as Prabodh. III <skt>āvāso layanaṃ manoharam} cp. the schol. p. 57 ed. Calc. <skt>dvayam api manoharam}; Daç. 135 <skt>kāntimatī rājyam idaṃ mama ca jīvitam apy adyaprabhṛti tvad adhīnam} (Kântimatî and this kingdom and my own life are at your mercy from this moment). — This practically has the same effect as applying the Rem. on b.) of the other alternative, recorded on page 20.</p>
    <p><i>or</span> it has a grammatical expression adequate to its character of being common to more substantives at the same time. In that case:</p>
    <p>a. ) the <b>number</span> required is of course the <b>dual</span> when relating to two individuals, otherwise the <b>plural</span>. <skt>rāmo lakṣmaṇaśca mahāvīrau}; — <skt>rāmaḥ sītā ca lakṣmaṇaśca vana uṣitāḥ}. Cp. the Rem, on b.).</p>
    <p>b. ) as to the <b>gender</span> there must be distinguished between persons and things. When relating to persons of the same sex, the common predicate or attribute is of the same gender: <skt>pitā bhrātā ca dvāv api / mātā svasā ca dve api}<i>.</span> When applying to persons of different sex, it is always put in the masculine: <skt>pitā mātā ca dvāv api}<i>.</span> But when belonging to inanimate things or things and persons mixed, it is neuter. Kâm. 1, 54 <skt>mṛgayā ‘kṣāstathā pānaṃ garhitāni mahībhujām}; M. 4, 39 <skt>mṛdaṅgaṃ daivataṃ vipraṃ ghṛtaṃ madhu catuṣpatham / pradakṣiṇāni kurvīta}<i>.</span></p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. If neuter words are mixed with words of other gender, it is allowed to put their common predicate or attribute in the neuter of the <i>singular</span>. {P. 1, 2, 69.} Mrcch. V <skt>pakṣavikalaś ca pakṣī śuṣkaś ca taruḥ saraś ca jalahīnaṃ / sarpaś codṛtadaṃṣṭras tulyaṃ loke daridraś ca} (the bird, whose wings are clipped, the leafless tree, the desiccated pool, the toothless snake are equal in the eyes of men, so the moneyless man).</p>
    <p>c.) as to the <b>person</span>. In the case of difference, the first person outweighs the second and third, and the second precedes the third (see Pat I, p. 352, cp. 240, n° 26, Kât. 3, 1, 4). Patanjali gives these examples <skt>tvaṃ ca devadattaś ca pacathaḥ / ahaṃ ca devadattaś ca pacāvaḥ / tvaṃ cāhaṃ ca pacāvaḥ}.</p>
