    <p>280. Interrogatives.</p>
    <p>The <<b>>interrogative pronoun</span> is <skt>ka}. Its comparative <skt>katara} and its superlative <skt>katama} are likewise used. The positive <skt>ka} simply asks „who ?’’ „what ?’’ „which ?’’, <skt>katara} like Lat. <i>uter</span>, arch. Eng. <i>whether</span> „which of the two ?’’, <skt>katama} „who etc. of many ?’’ They are wanted both in direct questions and in the so-called indirect questions. One says, therefore, <skt>ko bhavān} (who are you ?), <skt>devadatta etayoḥ kataraḥ} (which of these two is Devadatta ?), Vikram. I, p. 5 <skt>parijñāyate katamena digvihbhāgena gataḥ sa jālmaḥ} (is it known, in what direction the rascal has departed1). Cp. 411.</p>
    <p>If wanted, <skt>ka} may be the former part of a bahuvrîhi. Daç. 30 <skt>etatkaṭakādhipatiḥ kiṃnāmadheyaḥ} (what is the name of the chief of this encampment ?); ibid. 74 — an ascetic speaks — <skt>arthakāmavārttānabhijñā vayaṃ jñeyau cemau kiṃrūpau kiṃparivārau kiṃphalau}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. The distinction between <skt>ka}, <skt>katara} and <skt>katama} is not always strictly observed. Râm. 11 sarga 38 Râma asks Viçvâmitra, which of the two, Kadrû or Vinatâ will have one illustrious son, and who sixty thousand sons <skt>ekaḥ kasyāḥ suto brahmankā bahṛñcanayiṣyati}, here <skt>ka} used, not <skt>katara}. — Panc. 284 <skt>sāmādīnām upāyānāṃ madhye kasyātra viṣayaḥ} (for which of the six well-known expedients, <i>sâma</span> etc., it is now the fit time ?) here <skt>kasya} is used within the proper sphere of <skt>katama}. — R. 2, 85, 4 Bharata asks Guha <skt>katareṇa gamiṣyāmi bharadvājāśramaṃ pathā}, though the country is wholly unknown to him, and he, therefore, does not want to be informed »whether’’ but »which’’ of the many ways will conduct him to Bharadvâja (*1).</p>
