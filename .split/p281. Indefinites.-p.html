    <p>281. Indefinites.</p>
    <p>At the outset <skt>ka} was both an interrogative and an indefinite pronoun, cp. Lat. <i>quis</span>, Gr. <i>τίς</span> and <i>τὶς</span>. In classic Sanskrit it has occasionally still the function of an indefinite; yet, as a rule, <skt>ka} is then combined with some particle: <skt>cit} or <skt>api} or <skt>cana}. Hence <skt>kaścit}, <skt>kaścana}, <skt>ko ‘pi} are the proper <<b>>indefinite pronouns</span>, expressing <i>some(any)body, some(any)thing; some, any</span>. To them we must add <skt>eka} for this word, properly meaning ,,one,’’ does not rarely duty as an indefinite, and is to be rendered by ,,some&quot; and even by the so-called article ,,a.’’ — <skt>sarva} is ,,every; all.’’</p>

    <p>{kaścit, etc. and eka}</p>
    <p>Instances of <skt>kaścit}, <skt>kaścana}, <skt>ko’pi} (*1) it is superfluous to give. As to <skt>eka} = »a.’’ R. 2 , 63, 32 <skt>ahaṃ caikeṣuṇā hataḥ} (I am hit by an arrow), Daç. 25 <skt>kadācid ekasmin kāntāre madauyasahacaragaṇena jighāṃsyamānaṃ bhūsuram ekam avalokya} (once in some forest I saw some brahman being about to be hurt by the crowd of my companions). Even <skt>kaścit} etc. may be = »a’’: Daç. 132 <skt>sā kaṃcitsutaṃ sūtavato} (she was delivered of a son). It is consistent, that <skt>eka} may also be combined with some other indefinite. Kathâs. 27, 89 <skt>kasyāpyekasya baṇijaḥ sādhuḥ karmakaro gṛhe} (an honest servant in the house of some merchant), Panc. 9 <skt>ekasya kasya cicchilpanaḥ}.</p>
    <p>Kathâs. 1, 56 may be an instance of the sole <skt>ka}, bearing the character of an indefinite: <skt>nānyo jānāti kaḥ} (and nobody else knows it). Cp. R. 2, 32, 42 <skt>vṛṇīṣva kiṃ cedaparaṃ vyavasyasi} (choose something else, if you have made up your mind).</p>

    <p>{viśva.}</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. The old dialect possessed a synonym of <skt>sarva}, viz. <skt>viśva} in the classic language it is no more used, save in some standing phrases as <skt>viśve devāḥ}, being the name of some special class of deities, <skt>viśvaṃ jagat} or simply <skt>viśvam} ,,the Universe.’’</p>

    <p>{sarva.}</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2 <skt>sarva} is = »every’’ and »each,’’ <skt>sarvaḥ} »everybody,’’ <skt>sarvam} »everything.’’ Nala. 20, 6 <skt>sarvaḥ sarvaṃ na jānāti sarvajño nāsti kaścana} (not everybody does know everything, nobody is omniscient).</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>According to the Petrop. Dict. the indefinite pronoun <skt>ko ’pi} was made in a latter period than the other combinations, as it does not occur in the older literature, Manu included (see. II, p. 6 <i>s. v.</span> <skt>ka}). Yet in the Mahâbhârata and the Râmayaṇa <skt>ko’pi} and such adverbs as <skt>kvāpi}, <skt>katham api} are as well met with as those in <skt>-cit} and <skt>-cana}. R. 2, 52, 45 <skt>ka} and <skt>api} are separated by <skt>ca}, <skt>ahaṃ kiṃ cāpi vakṣyāmi}.</p>
