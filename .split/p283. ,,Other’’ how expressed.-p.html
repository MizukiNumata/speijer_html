    <p>283. „Other” how expressed.</p>
    <p>There are several words for „other”, viz. <skt>anya}, <skt>apara}, <skt>para}, <skt>itara}. Of these <skt>anyaṃ} is the most common and has the most general meaning.</p>

    <p>1. <skt>anya} generally denotes »somebody or something else.” In such phrases as <skt>anyasminnahani}, »once on a day” it is almost = <skt>kaścit}. Yet it may also signify »the other.” So Hit. 102 when a messenger wishes to speak secretly to the king, the king removes his attendance <skt>tato rājā mantrī ca sthitau tatra / anye ‘nyatra gatāḥ} (— <i>the others</span> withdrew).</p>
    <p>2. <skt>apara} properly means »the subsequent, the following;” hence it has got also the meaning of »other,” but commonly it retains its proper nature of signifying what is named in the second place. Mrcch. I, p. 55 <skt>iyaṃ sā radanikā / iyam aparā kā} (this is Radanikâ, but this other, who is she ?).</p>
    <p>3. <skt>para} is etymologically related to our <i>far</span>, and accordingly it serves also to denote the opposite of <skt>sva}. Hence it displays all shades of meaning, as are directly opposite to the notion of »own, proper.” It may be sometimes = »’strange’ and »stranger,” sometimes = »enemy,” sometimes also when used in a broader sense = »other.” Nala 3, 8 <skt>kathaṃ nu jātasaṃkalpaḥ striyam utsahate pumān parārthamīdṛśaṃ vaktum} (how should a man bear to speak in this way for the sake of another to a woman, whom he desires for himself ?). Mrcch. I, p. 55 <skt>na yuktaṃ parakalatradarśanam} (it does not become a man to look on the wife of his neighbour). Its adjective <skt>parakīya} = <i>alienus</span>. Çâk. IV <skt>artho hi kanyā parakīya eva} (a daughter is a possession one cannot call one’s own).</p>
    <p>4. <skt>itara}, the comparative of the pronominal root <skt>i}, bears a strong affinity to Latin <i>alter</span>. It is used, indeed, to signify »the one” and »the other” of two. Bṛh. Âr. Up. 1, 4, 4 <skt>baḍavetarābhavad aśvavṛṣa itaraḥ}, cp. M. 4, 137, Kathās. 19, 60. When dual or plural, it denotes the other of two parties. Mrcch. I, p. 38 <skt>brahmakṣatraviśastaranti ca yayā nāvā tayaivetare}, Mudr. V, p.184 <skt>teṣāṃ madhye ye trayaḥ pradhānatamā madīyāṃ bhūmiṃ kāmayante te… / itarau tu dvau hastibalakāmau hastinaiva ghātyetāṃ}. — Cp. 217, 2.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. To the foresaid pronouns we may add <skt>bhinna} »different,” as it sometimes may be rendered by „other.” Kâç. on P. 2, 3, 29 <skt>bhinno devadattāt} = <skt>anyo devadattāt}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. <skt>apara} and <skt>anya}, when qualifying some noun, may be used in a somewhat particular manner. Panc. p. 77 contains the story of the jackal who, being hunted by a band of dogs, fled to some dyer’s and there jumped into a pot filled with dye. As he got out, he had got a blue colour, <skt>tatrāpare sārameyāstaṃ sṛgālamajānanto yathābhīṣṭadiśaṃ jagmuḥ}. Here <skt>apare sārameyāḥ} means »the other, namely the dogs,” not „the other dogs.” Compare ibid. p. 83 <skt>kasmiṃścid vanoddeśe siṃhaḥ prativasati sma / tasya cānucarā anye dvīpivāyasagomāyavaḥ santi}. Here <skt>anye} does not mean »other panters etc.,” but »others, namely a panter, a crow and a jackal.” Cp. R. 2, 71, 61 <skt>anyā vidhavā} = »some widow;” Schol. <skt>anyetyasya vivaraṇaṃ vidhaveti}. — The same idiom exists in Latin and Greek, f. i. Od. <i>β</span>, 411 <i>μήτηρ δ᾽ ἐμὴ οὔ τι πέπυσται, οὐδ᾽ ἄλλαι δμωαί</span>(*tn-1).</p>
