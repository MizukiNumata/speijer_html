    <p>287. How generalized.</p>
    <p>The relative pronoun may be generalized in various ways: <i>a</span>) by putting <skt>ya} twice, then <skt>yo yaḥ} = ,,whosoever,’’ and it requires <skt>sa sa} in the apodosis; <i>b</span>) by adding to it one of the indefinite pronouns so as to make up the combination <skt>yaḥ kaścit}, <skt>yaḥ kaścana} or <skt>yaḥ ko’pi}; <i>c</span>) by putting together <skt>ya} and <skt>sa} in the same case, gender and number, <skt>yaḥ saḥ} = ,,whosoever it may be, any.’’ For the rest, cp. 453.</p>
    <p>Examples of <i>a</span>). Nala. 5, 11 is quoted 276; Bhojapr. 36 <skt>yaṃyaṃ nṛpo ‘nurāgeṇa saṃmānayati saṃsadi / tasya tasyotsāraṇāya yatante rājavallabhāḥ} (the king’s favourites always plot to the ruin of whomsoever the king loves and honours in his court).</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) Mudr. IV, p. 158 <skt>yaḥ kaścin māṃ draṣṭum icchati sa tvayā praveśayitavyaḥ} (whosoever it may be, that wishes to see me, you most admit him), Nala 4, 2 <skt>ahaṃ caiva yaccānyanmamāsti kiñcana} (myself and whatsoever belongs to me). This idiom is used so as to be synonymous with the simple indefinite pronoun, as Hitop. 10 <skt>suvarṇakaṅkaṇaṃ yasmai kasmaicid dātum icchāmi} (I desire to give the golden bracelet to whomsoever); Schol. on R. 3, 10, 19 <skt>yasmai kasmā api pratijñāṃ pratijñāya na jahyām}(*1).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The archaic dialect used also <skt>yaḥ kaśca} = <skt>yaḥ kaścit}. So f. i Ch. Up. s, 15, 4 <skt>prāṇo vā idaṃ bhūtaṃ yadidaṃ kiṃca} (<i>prâṇa</span> means all whatever exists here), Ait. Br. 2, 6, 5 <skt>yasyai kasyai ca devatāyai paśur ālabhyate saiva medhapatir iti}. It occurs also sometimes in epic poetry. So Hit. 20 the verse <skt>yāni kāni ca mitrāṇi kartavyāni śatāni ca} proves by its very language to be borrowed from some ancient epic poet.</p>
    <p>c.) Kathâs. 27, 208 <skt>itthaṃ kriyāsu nivasanty api yāsu tāsu / puṃsāṃ śriyaḥ prabalasattvabahiṣkṛtāsu} (in this way fortune dwells in <i>any</span> action, done by men, when carried out with vigorous energy).</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p><skt>yaḥ ko’pi} seems to occur much less than the other combinations. The Petr. Dict. gives no instance of it, Anandoram Borooah does not mention it.</p>
