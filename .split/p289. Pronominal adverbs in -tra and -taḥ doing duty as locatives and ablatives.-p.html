    <p>289. Pronominal adverbs in -tra and -taḥ doing duty as locatives and ablatives.</p>
    <p>The adverbs in <skt>-tra} and <skt>-taḥ} are not restricted to the denoting of space. {P. 5, 3, 7 sqq.} Their province is the same, as that of the locative and ablative (*1). Such words as <skt>ataḥ} and <skt>tataḥ} have the value of the ablatives <skt>asmāt}, <skt>tasmāt} etc., that is of the ablat. of the stems <skt>a} and <skt>ta} in all genders and numbers. Similarly <skt>atra}, <skt>tatra} are identical with the locatives <skt>asmin}, <skt>tasmin} etc. For this reason, like the real ablatives and locatives, they express not only space, but also time and circumstances, and refer equally to persons and things. When pointing to a singular, they may even be used as attributes of ablatives and locatives of substantives. The adverbs <skt>kva} and <skt>iha}, though not made with the suffix <skt>-tra}, have similarly the functions of the locative of the stems <skt>ka} and <skt>i} in all genders and numbers.</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. of their not referring to space. Kathâs. 4, 20 <skt>varṣasya śiṣyavargo mahānabhūt / tatraikaḥ pāṇinir nāma jaḍabuddhitaro’bhavat} (Varsha had a great crowd of disciples; among them there was —). Mudr. IV, p. 145 <skt>kim idānīṃ candraguptaḥ svarājyakāryadhurāmanyatra mantriṇyātmani vā samāsajya —} (why has Candrag. now. put the yoke of government on [the shoulders of] some other minister or his own…?). Çâk. III <skt>ayaṃ sa te tiṣṭhati saṃgamotsukaḥ / viśaṅkase bhīro yato’vadhīraṇām} (he, from whom you are apprehending a refusal, that man stands here longing to meet you). Kumâras. 2, 55 <skt>itaḥ sa daityaḥ prāptaśrīrneta evārhati kṣayam} (it is from this man [me, cp. 273) that the Daitya has obtained his glory, therefore it is not I, who must kill him). Mudr. II, p. 86 <skt>amātyanāmāṅkiteyaṃ mudā / tadito bahutareṇārthena bhavantamamātyastoṣatiṣyati} (this ring is engraved with the name of the minister; for this reason, he will reward you with more than [is the worth of] this [ring]). Cp. Nala. 13, 44.</p>
    <p>2. of their qualifying some substantive. — Panc. 273 <skt>tatra vane bhraman} (rambling in that forest), ibid. IV, 71 <skt>parasminniha loke ca} (in the other world and in this), ibid. p. 146 <skt>bhikṣāśeṣaṃ ca tatraiva bhikṣāpātre nidhāya} (— put the rest of the alms in that very begging-bowl), ibid. 147 <skt>ekatra kuśasaṃstare dvāv api prasuptau} (they slept both on one couch of kuça-grass), Kathâs. 27, 4 <skt>prasaṅge kutrāpi} (at some emergency), Daç. 80 <skt>ahasaṃ ca kiñcitpramādadattaśārike kvacitkitave} (and I laughed somehow at some player making a rash move); — Panc. 308 <skt>tataḥ sthānātsvadeśaṃ gatāḥ} (from that place they went to their country), ibid. 286 <skt>kuto’pi dhanikātkiñcid dravyamādāya} (he took some money from a moneylender), Prabodh. I, p. 6 <skt>kuto’pi kāraṇavaśāt} (by some cause), Daç. 96 <skt>māṃ kadācidanarthāditastārayiṣyati} (perhaps, it will rescue me from this misadventure).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. It must be mentioned, that in the case of the <i>anvâdeça</span> (274) <skt>atra} and <skt>ataḥ} are enclitics. {P. 2, 4, 33.} So neither <skt>iha} nor <skt>itaḥ} can be used.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Instances of the adverbs in <skt>-tra} and <skt>-taḥ} denoting time, are not rare. So one uses <skt>ataḥ param} = »afterwards” <skt>tataḥ} = »then,” <skt>kvacit…kvacit} may be= »sometimes.... sometimes.”</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p><skt>-taḥ} is a common suffix expressive of the abl., and accordingly put also after nouns (108). Locatives in <skt>-trā} made of nouns are taught by P. 5, 4, 55 sq. But such forms as <skt>brāhmaṇatrā}, <skt>devatrā}, <skt>martyatrā} are only met with in the archaic dialect. Yet, though obsolete in the classic period of Sanskrit literature, they must have been in common use in the time of Pâṇini.</p>
