    <p>There is no proper adverbial suffix for the category of the ,,whither.’’ Nor is it necessary. For the locative being expressive of the aim and scope with the words of <i>going</span>, <i>arriving</span>, <i>entering</span> and the like (134), it results, that one says <skt>kva gacchāmi}, <skt>tatra pratasthe} and so on, as well as <skt>nagare gacchāmi}, <skt>nagare pratasthe}. On the other hand, since the adverbs in <skt>-taḥ} may have the meaning of ,,on the side of,’’ cp. 103, <skt>kutaḥ} may be ,,on what side ?’’ <skt>itaḥ} ,,on this side’’ etc. Moreover they may even signify ,,in what direction,’’ f. i. <skt>tataḥ} = ,,towards that place.’’</p>
