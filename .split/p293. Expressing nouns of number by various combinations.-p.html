    <p>293. Expressing nouns of number by various combinations.</p>
    <p>As Sanskrit grammars not only teach, which are the different nouns of number for the unities, decads etc., but also how to make the interjacent ones (see f. i. Whitney § 476 and 477), this point may be passed over here. It will suffice to give some instances of the most usual idioms for expressing numbers higher than 100. So Varâh. Brh. 11, 5 <skt>śatam ekādhikam} = 101, Ch. Up. 3, 16, 7 <skt>śoḍaśaṃ varṣaśatam} »116 years’’ [liter. a hundred of years, determined by sixteen]. {Cp. P. 5, 2, 45.} — Of addition, as f. i. <skt>pañca daśa ca} = <skt>pañcadaśa}, instances are found very often, especially in poetry. — Expressing numbers by multiplication is not rare, either by saying f. i. <skt>dviḥ pañca} instead of <skt>daśa}, or by using the type <skt>tisro ‘śītayaḥ} = 240 [lit. three eighties], cp. 295. Mhbh. 1, 32, 24 <skt>navatyā navatīrmukhānāṃ kṛtvā} (having made 8100 mouths) we have an instance of multiplication expressed by the instrumental of the multiplicator.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. A very singular manner of denoting numbers between 200 and 1000, mentioned by Whitney § 480, is met with now and then in the dialect of the liturgical books and in epic poetry. Çânkh. Br. 3, 2 <skt>troṇi ṣaṣṭiśatāni saṃvatsarasyāhnām}, the meaning of which is »360 is the number of the days of a year,’’ not, as one would infer from the very form, 3 × 160. Çânkh. Çr. 16, 8, 9 <skt>dve aśītiśate} = 280. So R. 2, 39, 36 <skt>trayaḥ śataśatārdhā mātaraḥ} are not = 3 × 150, but = 350, cp. ibid. 2, 34, 13, where the same number is thus expressed: <skt>ardhasaptaśatāḥ} = half-seven hundreds, that is 3 1/2 × 100.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. In the ancient dialect cardinal nouns of number show in some degree a tendency to become indeclinable words. See Whitney § 486 <i>c.</span>), who gives instances from vaidik works. But classic Sanskrit disapproved that loss of flexion and checked it (*1).</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>As a rest of it we may consider, that M. 8, 268 and Kathâs. 44, 77 the nom. <skt>pañcāśat} does duty of an accusative.</p>
