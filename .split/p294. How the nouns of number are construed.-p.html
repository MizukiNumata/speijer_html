    <p>294. How the nouns of number are construed.</p>
    <p>From 1-19 the cardinal nouns of number are adjectives, but 20 and the rest are properly substantives. So <skt>viṃśatiḥ} does not signify ,,twenty’’ fr. <i>vingt</span>, but ,,a number of twenty,’’ fr. <i>une vingtaine</span>. For this reason, <skt>viṃśatiḥ} and the rest, <skt>śatam}, <skt>sahasram} etc. are not only singulars having a gender of their own, but they are also construed with the genitive. Yet, this construction is not used exclusively. By a false analogy side by side with the regular construction, as <skt>viṃśatiḥ purāṇām}, <skt>śataṃ purāṇām}, one says also <skt>viṃśatiḥ purāṇi}, <skt>śataṃ purāṇi}, instr. <skt>viṃśatyā purāṇām} or <skt>puraiḥ}, <skt>śatena purāṇām} or <skt>puraiḥ}, etc. The same applies of course to the compounds in <skt>-viṃśatiḥ}, <skt>-śatam} etc., expressive of the interjacent numbers. — It is a matter of course, that instead of using the genitive, it is allowed to compound the substantive with the noun of number.</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. <i>a</span>) of a genitive depending on the noun of number: Varâh. Brh. 54, 75 <skt>viṃśatyā puruṣāṇām} (by 20 men); Ragh. 3, 69 <skt>iti kṣitīśo navatiṃ navādhikāṃ mahākratūnāṃ… tatāna} (thus the king performed 99 great sacrifices); R. 2, 54, 31 <skt>śaradāṃ śatam}; Mhbh. 14, 88, 35 <skt>yūpeṣu niyatā cāsotpaśūnāṃ triśatī tayā} (300 animals were then fastened to the sacrificial piles); Kathâs. 18, 124 <skt>dadau… vidṛṣakāya sahasraṃ grāmāṇām}, Daç. 142 <skt>subhaṭānām anekasahasram asty eva} — <i>b</span>) of compounding: Râj. 1, 311 <skt>sa varṣaptatiṃ bhuktvā bhuvam} (after having reigned seventy years), M. 8, 237 <skt>dhanuḥśatam} (a hundred bow-lengths), Kathâs. 44, 77 <skt>uṣṭrapañcaśatīṃ} (500 camels).</p>
    <p>2. of <skt>viṃśati} etc. concording in case with their substantives. — R. 3, 14, 10 <skt>prajāpatestu dakṣasya babhūvuḥ… ṣaṣṭir duhitaraḥ}, Gaut. 8, 8 <skt>catvāriṃ śatā saṃskāraiḥ saṃskṛtaḥ} (purified by 40 sacraments), M. 3, 40 <skt>jīvanti śataṃ samāḥ}, ibid. 4, 87 <skt>yāti… narakānekaviṃśatim}, Kathâs. 10, 39 <skt>vayaṃ daityapaterbaleḥ pautryo daśaśatam} (we are 1000 granddaughters of the chief of Daityas, Bali); Mhbh. 1, 16, 8 <skt>vavre kadrūḥ sutānnāgānsahasraṃ tulyavarcasaḥ}.</p>
    <p>Higher numbers, as <skt>ayutam}, <skt>lakṣam}, <skt>koṭiḥ}, are substantives, and always construed with the genitive of the object numbered. R. 1, 53, 21 <skt>dadāmy ekāṃ gavāṃ koṭim} (I give a crore of cows); Panc, I, 251 <skt>na gajānāṃ sahasreṇa na ca lakṣeṇa vājinām / yatkṛtyaṃ sādhyate rājñāṃ durgeṇaikena sidhyati} (designs of kings, that do not succeed by a thousand elephants nor by a hundred thousand horse, are successful by one stronghold).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. The double construction of <skt>viṃśati} etc. is as old as the Rgveda. Cp. f. i. Rgv. 2, 18, 5 <skt>catvāriṃśatā haribhiḥ} with Rgv. 5, 18, 5 <skt>ye me pañcāśataṃ daduraśvānām}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. In epic poetry one meets occasionally with a plural of the decade instead of the singular. Nala. 26, 2 <skt>pañcāśaddhir hayaiḥ} (with fifty horses) instead of <skt>pañcāśatā hayaiḥ}.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, a singular of the substantive construed with <skt>śata} and <skt>sahasra} occurs now and then, as Hariv. 1823 <skt>sahasreṇa bāhuṇā} [instead of <skt>bāhubhiḥ} or<skt>bāhūnām}], Bhâg. Pur. 4, 29, 24 <skt>varṣaṃ śatam}(*1).</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Another singular idiom occurs R. 1, 18, 8 <skt>ṛtūnāṃ ṣaṭ samatyayuḥ} (the six seasons passed), as if <skt>ṣaṭ} meant »a hexad,’’ not »six.’’ Cp. <i>Verz. der Berliner Sanskrithandschriften</span>, n°. 834.</p>
