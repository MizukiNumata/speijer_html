    <p>299. Nouns of number, being members of compounds.</p>
    <p>Cardinals may often be the latter members of compounds, see 294 and 296.</p>
    <p>When former members, they may make up with their latter members the so-called <b>dvigus</span>. This term is applied to two different kinds of compounds, viz. 1. the collective compounds, made up of a cardinal + a noun subst., and employed in a collective sense; they must be of the neuter gender, as <skt>catuṣpatham} (juncture of four roads), but themes in <skt>-a} may be feminines in <skt>-ī} as well as neuters in <skt>-am}, as <skt>trilokam} or <skt>trilokī} (the three worlds){P. 2, 1, 23.}; 2. compound adjectives, which rank with the bahuvrîhis, but the notion inherent to which is not that of „possession,’’ but some other. So the word <skt>dvigu} itself, meaning „bought for [having the value of] two cows.’’ {P. 2, 1, 52.} Ait. Br. 1, 1, 6 <skt>ejādaśakapālaḥ puroḍāśaḥ} (a cake <i>dressed on</span> eight plates)(*tn-1).</p>
    <p>Beside this special use, the cardinals may be parts of the general tatpurushas and bahuvrîhis, especially the latter. Such bahuvrîhis as <skt>daśāsyaḥ} (having ten faces), <skt>viṃśatibāhuḥ} (with twenty arms), are, in practice, by far more frequent than the adjectival dvigus. Yâjñ. 2, 125 <skt>catustridvyekabhāgāḥ syurvarṇaśo brāhmaṇātmajāḥ} (the sons of a brahman <i>own</span> according to the caste [of their mother] four, three, two and one portions), Pat. I, p. 62 <skt>tripado’yam bahuvrīhiḥ} (this bahuvrîhi <i>is</span> of three elements).</p>
