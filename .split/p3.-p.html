    <p>Besides <skt>asti} and <skt>bhavati}, the verbs <skt>vidyate}, <skt>tiṣṭha}, <skt>vartate} and the participle <skt>gata} may be used more or less as <i>verbum substantivum</span>. Schol. on P. 3, 4, 65 (*1) <skt>vidyate bhoktum} (there is something to eat), Ven. III p. 94 <skt>eṣa duryodhana asyāṃ nyagrodhacchāyāyām upaviṣṭas tiṣṭhati} (here D. is sitting down under the shade—), Hit. 107 <skt>vāyasarājño dvāri vartate} (the king of the crows is at the door).

By consequence, <skt>bhavati} is the proper verb, if there he laid some stress on the predicate, in other terms, if it be pointed out that the subject is invested with the dignity or possesses the quality predicated of it. Ch. Up. 6, 16, 1 it is said with respect to somebody, seized on account of a theft, apparently committed by him <skt>sa yadi tasya kartā bhavati} [not <skt>asti}]; Panc. III, 57 <skt>vanāni dahato vahneḥ sakhā bhavati mārutaḥ} (when the fire burns the wood, wind is his mate), Mhbh. 1, 89, 2 <skt>yo vidyayā tapasā janmanā vā vṛddhaḥ sa pūjyo bhavati dvijānām}.</p>
