    <p>301. Fractions, how expressed.</p>
    <p><<b>>Fractions</span> are expressed, as with us, by ordinal numbers, <i>either</span> accompanied by some word meaning »part,’’ as in the proverbial phrase <skt>kalāṃ nārhati ṣoḍaśīm} (see f. i. Panc. II, 61, M. 2, 86), Ragh. 2, 66 <skt>upabhoktuṃ ṣaṣṭāṃśamurvyāḥ} (to enjoy the sixth part of the earth), <i>or</span> put alone, when substantives of the neuter gender M. 8, 398 <skt>tato viṃśaṃ nṛpo haret} (the king must take the twentieth part of it).</p>
    <p>Moreover, they may be denoted also by compounds made up of a cardinal number + such a word as <skt>bhāga}, <skt>aṃśa} etc. M. 8, 140 <skt>aśītibhāgaṃ gṛhṇīyāt} (be may take 1/80); ibid. 304 <skt>dharmaṣaḍbhāgaḥ} (a sixth part of the virtue); Kumâras. 5, 57 <skt>tribhāgaśeṣāsu niśāsu} (when but a third part of the night is left); Varâh. Brh. 53, 25 <skt>pañcāśaḥ} = 1/5 (*1).</p>
    <p>Very common are <skt>ardham} = 1/2 and <skt>pādaḥ} = 1/4. They are substantives and accordingly coustrued with a genitive, but often also compounded. Note such turns as Bhoj. 48 <skt>sapādaśataṃ gajendrāḥ} (125 tall elephants, lit. a hundred + a fourth of it), R. 2, 39, 36 <skt>ardhasaptaśatāḥ pramadāḥ} = half seven-hundred women, that is 350. Râj. 1, 286 <skt>tatsūnusriṃśataṃ sārdhāṃ varṣāṇām anvaśānmahīm} (— reigned 45 years —). Such numbers as 1 1/2, 2 1/2 etc. are signified by the compounds <skt>ardhadvitīya}, <skt>ardhatṛtīya} etc., that are adjectives and bahuvrîhis, literally meaning »the second, third etc. being [but] half’’ (*2). M. 4, 95 <skt>yuktaś chāndāṃsy adhīyīta māsān vipro ‘rdhapañcamān} (for 4 1/2 month a brahman must study the vedic texts). »One and a half’’ is also <skt>adhyardham} [literally = »with a half more’’], as <skt>adhyardhaśatam} = 150.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. How the interest of money is denoted, may appear from this passage of Manu (8, 142: <skt>dvikaṃ trikaṃ catuṣkaṃ ca pañcakaṃ ca śataṃ samam / māsasya vṛddhiṃ gṛhṇīyād varṇānām anupūrvaśaḥ} (he may take 2, 3, 4 and 5 0/0 a month according to the caste).</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>This mode of designating fractions is however not free from ambiguousness, as <skt>tribhāga} may denote also »three parts.’’ See Mallin. on Kumâras. 5, 57. Nor are compounds, beginning with <skt>ardha-} always exempt from it. So f. i. <skt>ardhaśatam} may be = half a hundred that is 50, or = a hundred + half of it, that is 150. R. 2, 34, 13 <skt>ardhasaptaśatāḥ} is explained in the Petr. Dict., as being 750, but Gorresio is right in accepting it = 350.</p>

    <p>On this subject see the disputation of Patanjali I, p. 426 who, as is often the case, rather obscures than illustrates the subject which he treats.</p>
