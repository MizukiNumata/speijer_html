    <p>302. Other remarks.</p>
    <p>By being repeated, cardinals or ordinals acquire a distributive meaning, see 252, 3-. Panc. 194 <skt>tribhis tribhir guptacaraiḥ} = <i>per ternos speculatores</span>, Vâr. Yog. 2, 35 <skt>pañcame pañcame ‘hni} (every fifth day). The same duty may be done by adverbs in <skt>-śaḥ}, especially by <skt>bahuśaḥ}, <skt>śataśaḥ}, <skt>sahasraśaḥ} »by hundreds, by thousands,’’ also »in hundred, thousand ways, manifold’’, <skt>gaṇaśaḥ} (by crowds), f. i. Çat. Br. 14, 4, 2, 24, etc.</p>
    <p>The proper employment of the adverbs in <skt>-dhā} is to indicate a real division of a whole into so and so many parts. M. 7, 173 <skt>dvidhā balaṃ kṛtvā} (divided his forces in two parts), Kathâs. 106, 133 <skt>tadā te śatadhā vidaliṣyati} (— into a hundred pieces).</p>
    <p>Our adjectives in — <i>fold</span>, etc. are represented in Sanskrit by compounds in <skt>-guṇa} — see the dictionary — as <skt>dviguṇa} (twofold, double), <skt>triguṇa}, <skt>caturguṇa}, <skt>sahasraguṇa}.</p>
    <p>The standard of comparison is here of course put in the ablative, cp. 106 R. 2.</p>
