    <p>304. Causatives.</p>
    <p>The <b>causatives</span> are expressive of such actions, whose subject is not the agent, but he at whose prompting the agent acts, as <skt>devadattaḥ kaṭaṃ kārayati} (N. N. gets the mat made). {P. 3, 1, 26.} They are much used both in the active and in the passive voice. Their special construction has been dealt with in full (49-51).</p>
    <p>On the middle voice of causatives see 318, espec. c.).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Occasionally the causatives are used without a causative meaning, as if they were primitives (*1). R. 1, 5, 9 <skt>purīmāvāsayāmāsa} (he inhabited the town); Prabodh. II, p. 43 <skt>vṛttam aghātayat surapatiḥ}, here <skt>aghātayat} is quite synonymous with <skt>ahan}.</p>
    <p>Panc. 168 <skt>kiṃ mām upālambhayasi} = <skt>upālabhase}, ibid. 257 <skt>bho mitra kim adyaciravelāyāṃ samāyāto ‘si / kasmāt sāhlādaṃ nālāpayasi} [= <skt>nālapasi}]. Thus often in the prâkṛts. Sometimes the primitive and its causative are used pro­miscuously, as <skt>dharati} and <skt>dhārayati}, both »to bear.” Sometimes there is some idiomatic difference, as in the phrase <skt>rājyaṃ kārayati} (to exercise the royal power), here the primitive is not used. Sometimes the primitive having got obsolete, the causative has been substituted for it, as <skt>vivāhayati} (to wed) instead of the archaic <skt>vivahate}; of which primitive it is only the participle <skt>vyūḍha} that is used in the classic dialect. In special cases refer to a dictionary.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>This employment of the causatives is termed by vernacular grammarians <skt>svārthe ṇic}.</p>
