    <p>305. Desideratives.</p>
    <p>The <<b>>desideratives</span> are expressive of the „wish of doing’’ the action, which is denoted by the verbal root: {P. 3, 1, 7.} <skt>cikīrṣati} = <skt>kartum icchati} (he wishes to do), <skt>lipsate} (he wishes to obtain). Sometimes they simply denote the „being about:’’ <skt>pipatiṣati phalam} (the fruit is about to fall). It is stated in express terms by native grammarians, that the employment of the desideratives is optional (*1) whereas the causatives cannot be periphrased. Accordingly, desideratives are less frequent in literature than causatives. They are not only met with when being finite verbs and participles, but also their derivatives in <skt>-ā} (subst.) and <skt>-u} (adj.), which may be made from any desiderative, as <skt>cikīrṣā} (the wish of doing), <skt>cikīrṣu} (wishing to do).</p>
    <p>Examples: Daç. 90 <skt>iyam arthanirapekṣā guṇebhya eva svaṃ yauvana vicikrīṣate kulastrīvṛttamevānutiṣṭāsati} (she does not care for wealth, it is for virtues alone that she wishes to sell her charms and she is desirous of behaving herself like a respectable lady), ibid. 25 <skt>madīyasahacaragaṇena jighāṃsyamānaṃ bhūsuramekamavalokya} (as I perceived some brahman, whom the crowd of my attendants were about to kill), Kathâs. 29, 157 <skt>rājā … mumūrṣurvyādhitaḥ} (the king being about to die of illness).</p>

    <p>P. 3, 1, 7 <skt>dhātoḥ karmaṇaḥ samānakartṛkād icchāyāṃ vā} sc. <skt>san} to be understood from s. 5. But in P. 3, 1, 26, which sûtra teaches the form and employment of the causatives, the particle of optionality is wanting.</p>
