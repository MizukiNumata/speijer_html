    <p>307. Denominatives.</p>
    <p>Various classes of <<b>>denominatives</span> are explained by Pâṇini (3, 1, 8-21; 25; 27-30). Among these, some verbs are very common in literature, as <skt>ākarṇayati} (to hear), <skt>miśrayati} (to mix), <skt>śabdāyate} (to cry), but they have nothing remarkable from a syntactic point of view, since the speaker uses them ready made and may use them even without being aware of their etymology. The denominatives which concern us here, are those which one can frame by one’s self, if wanted, such as <skt>putrīyati} intr. (he wishes a son), <skt>putroyati} trans. (he treats as a son), <skt>śyenāyate kākaḥ} (the crow behaves as if he were a falcon) and the like. Examples of them are occasionally met with in literature. Panc. I, vs. 5 <skt>iha loke hi dhanināṃ paro’pi svajanāyate / svajano’pi daridrāṇāṃ sarvadā durjanāyate} (here on earth even non-relatives behave towards the wealthy, as if they were their kinsmen, but to the poor even their own family are rather bad), Kâd. I, p. 30 <skt>sarvam eva devībhiḥ svayaṃ karatalopanīyamānam amṛtāyate} (everything which is given [to me] by the queen herself in her own hand, is as ambrosia), Bhoj. 61 <skt>somanāthena tvadgṛhabhikṣuṇādya mayi kalpadrumāyitam} (Somanâtha… has become a cornucopiae to me).</p>

    <p>{Inchoatives and Factitives.}</p>
    <p>Some of those in <skt>-āyate} convey the notion of coming into some state out of another quite opposite, as <skt>bhṛśāyate} (to become frequent [after having been infrequent], <skt>durmatāyate} (to grow sorry), <skt>śīghrāyate}, <skt>mandāyate}. {P. 3, 1, 12.} But the number of these <i>inchoatives</span> is limited, see Kâç. on P. 3, 1, 12. — Cp. 308.</p>
