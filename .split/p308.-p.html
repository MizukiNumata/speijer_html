    <p><b>Inchoatives</span> may be made of any noun, {P. 5, 4, 50.} by compounding it in a special manner with the verb <skt>bhū} (Whitney § 1094), {P. 7, 4, 26, 27 and 32.} as <skt>bhṛśībhavati} (to become frequent), <skt>śuklībhavati} (to become white). The same compounds, when made up with the verb <skt>kṛ} signify „to bring something into a state, the reverse of that, in which it was before (*1)’’ as <skt>śuklīkaroti} (to make white), <skt>kṛṣṇīkaroti} (to make black). These inchoatives are very common. Some of them have got some special meaning, as <skt>svīkṛ} (to get possession of), <skt>aṅgīkṛ} (to allow), <skt>kroḍīkṛ} (to embrace) see f. i. Nâgân. IV, p. 62.</p>
    <p>Examples: Daç. 59 <skt>sakalameva kanyāntaḥpuramākulībabhūva}, Çâk. II <skt>kṛtyayorbhinnadeśatvād dvaidhībhavati me manaḥ}; — Prabodh. II, p. 42 Krodha says <skt>andhīkaromi bhuvanaṃ badhirīkaromi} (I make the world blind and deaf), Mrcch. VIII, p. 256 <skt>duṣkaraṃ viṣamoṣadhīkartum} (it is difficult to change poison into medecine).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Pâṇini allows even inchoatives, made with the verb <skt>asti}. From the examples given by Kâç. it is likely, they do exist only in the optative: <skt>śuklīsyāt}. As far as I know, instances are not found in literature.</p>
