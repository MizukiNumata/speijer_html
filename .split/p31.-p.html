    <p>The distinction between <<b>>predicate</span> and <<b>>attribute</span> (*1) is chiefly a logical one. Formally both follow the same rules of syntax, and it is but by the context, partly also by the place it occupies in the sentence, we can learn how to understand a given samânâdhikaraṇa, whether <skt>vṛddhaḥ pitā} = „the old father” or = „the father is old.” etc.</p>
    <p>As to their meaning, then, we may distinguish five classes, I the simple <i>attribute</span>, <skt>vṛddhaḥ pitā} = „the old father,” II the so-called <i>predicative-attribute</span>, as <skt>vṛddhaḥ pitā} (= <skt>vṛddhaḥ san}) »the father, <i>when</span> old,” III the <i>noun-predicate of the sentence</span>, as <skt>vṛddhaḥ pitā} = „the father <i>is</span> old,” IV the <i>noun</span>, <i>wanted</span> by the verb for making up together the predicate of the sentence, as <skt>pitā vṛddhaḥ saṃpadhyate} (the father <i>grows old</span>), <skt>pitaraṃ vṛddhaṃ manyase} (you think the father old), V such a noun, as though formally agreeing with the subject or some other substantive, really serves to qualify the verb, as Daç. 141 <skt>mayāsi jātamātraḥ pāpayā pāratyaktaḥ}, see above, page 11 Rem.</p>
    <p>Of them the formal agreement of class I and II is fully made clear in <<b>>27</span>. As to class III see <<b>>5</span>.</p>

    <p>The term »attribute” in this book is virtually the same as the term <i>viçeshaṇa</span> of Hindu grammarians. It includes therefore the so called »apposition,” for I found no reason why I should retain the needless distinction, which is often made between attribute and apposition.</p>
