    <p>311. asmi and its employment.</p>
    <p>The verb substantive has been dealt with in the opening of this book (2 and 3). Here some remarks may be added:</p>
    <p>1. The negation put to <skt>bhavati} or <skt>asti} may signify »not to exist at all, to be lost or dead.’’ Mudr. VI, p. 197 <skt>yeṣāṃ prasādādidamāsītta eva na santi} (those, by whose favor I enjoyed all that glory, are now dead); R. 3, 31, 31 <skt>sītayā rahito rāmo na… bhaviṣyati}. Even the mere negation without verb may have this meaning. R. 3, 41, 19 Mârîca dissuades Râvaṇa from carrying off Sîtâ, saying <skt>ānayiṣyasi cetsītāmāśramātsahito mayā / naiva tvamapi nāhaṃ vai naiva laṅkā na rākṣasāḥ}.</p>
    <p>2. <skt>asti}, the 3rd pers. of the present, may be used almost as a particle in the beginning of tales and the like. (*1) It is then the very first word. Kathâs. 1, 27 Çiva begins to tell a story: <skt>asti māmīkṣituṃ pūrvaṃ brahmā nārāyaṇas tathā… himavatpādamūlamavāpatuḥ}, here <skt>asti} may be rendered by »well.’’ (*2) Sometimes it has the force of »it happens that,’’ as Pat. I, p. 48 <skt>asti punaḥ kvacidanyatrāpyapavāde pratiṣiddha utsarge’pi na bhavati} (but it happens also elsewhere that —), ibid. p. 444 <skt>ayam agnihotraśabdo’styeva jyotiṣi vartate… asti haviṣi vartate}.</p>
    <p>3. <skt>asmi}, the first person is now and then used instead of <skt>aham}. See Petr. Dict. I, p. 536 <i>s. v.</span> <skt>as} 6). — Daç. 158 <skt>so’hamasmi suhṛtsādhāṇabhramaṇakāraṇaḥ suhmaṣu… mahāntamutsavasamājamālokayam}, here <skt>ahamasmi} seems to be quite the same as <skt>aham}. Likewise <skt>asi} and <skt>tvamasi} may be occasionally used = <skt>tvam}, as is mentioned by Vâmana; see <i>Vâmana’s Stilregeln</span> by Cappeller, <i>Çabdaçuddhi</span> s. 12.</p>

    <p>Cp. the <i>imperatives</span> <skt>astu} and <skt>bhavatu}, which are used to express the necessity or suitableness of yielding to some outward circumstance, like Greek <i>εἶεν</span>. But the <i>present</span> <skt>asti} represents, that the request of him who wishes the tale to be told, is actually complied with.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>The frequent employment of this idiom may be inferred from this. In the <i>Pancatantra</span> ed. Jîvânanda there are 71 numbered tales. Of them, 45 begin with <skt>asti}, and though in most of them no finite verb is found in the first sentence — in 14 cases there is — yet in the great majority, if not in all, <skt>asti} is not necessary for the understanding. But in all of them, the tale is told at the request of somebody, likewise in the two passage, from the Kathâsaritsâgara, quoted by the Petr. Dict,, viz.1, 27 and 22, 56.</p>
