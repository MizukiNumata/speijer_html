    <p>314. The three voices of the Sanskrit verb.</p>
    <p>The Sanskrit verb has three voices: the active (<skt>parasmaipadam}), the medial (<skt>ātmanepadam}) and the passive. Of these, the active is formally different from the other two, but the medial and passive voices have many forms in common. The perfect <skt>cakre} may be = „he made [for himself]” as well as „he was made,” the future <skt>dhariṣyate} is either „he will bear [for himself]” or „he will be home. (*1)” But in the present and its system (present, imperfect, potential or optative, imperative, participle of the present) each voice has a different formal expression, <skt>kurute} etc. serving exclusively for the medium but <skt>kriyate} again having exclusively a passive meaning.</p>

    <p>Cp. f. i. Mhbh. 1, 159, 6 the future <skt>paritrāsye} (I shall rescue) with Daç. 96 <skt>paritrāsyete} (those two will be rescued) or Mhbh. 1, 188, 18 <skt>jagṛhe cārjuno dhanuḥ} (and Arjuna took the bow) with Kathâs. 71, 34 <skt>sa tayā kaṇṭhe jagṛhe} (he was embraced by her). It would be an interesting subject-matter for inquiry to draw a stasistical account of the common forms of the <i>âtmanepadam</span> with respect to their being used with a medial and with a passive meaning. It seems, indeed, that of several verbs these forms, especially the perfect, have the tendency of conveying exclusively a medial meaning, whereas some others seem to be exclusively passives. Before, however, such as account from standard authors will have been made, it would be premature to state something with certainty on this head.</p>
