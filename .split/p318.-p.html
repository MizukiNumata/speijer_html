    <p>Nevertheless, the original difference between active and medial is not lost. Not only the grammarians, who have invented the terms <i>parasmai padam</span> and <i>âtmane padam</span>, but the language itself shows, it is well aware of it. Several verbs may be employed in both voices in this way, that one avails one’s self of the medial especially to denote „the fruit of the action being for the subject,’’ {P. 1, 3, 72 foll.} f. i. <skt>devadattaḥ pacate} „N. N. cooks for himself,’’ but <skt>pacati}, when it is to be told, he cooks for others. Of the causatives the medial voice serves always for that purpose: <skt>kaṭaṃ kārayate} „he orders a mat to be made for his own behalf.’’ {P. 1, 3, 74.}</p>

    <p>{Proper sphere of the medium.}</p>
    <p>Within this proper sphere of the medium some distinctions may be made. The action may be done a.) by the subject himself in his own behalf, as Âpast. l, 26, 10 <skt>ete tribhir varṣair apa pāpaṃ nudante} (they remove the sin from themselves —), b.) by order of the subject, likewise for himself; of the kind is the medium of <skt>yaj}. <skt>yajate} is said of the patron, who makes the priests officiate for himself and who obtains the fruit of the sacrifice, whereas the officiating priests <skt>yajanti}, c.) so that the same person is both subject and object, as Ch. Up. 4, 4, 2 <skt>satyakāma eva jābālo bravīthāḥ} (you must name yourself —). Compare with a.) such Greek medial verbs as <i>πορίζομαι</span> „I acquire for myself,’’ with b.) such as <i>παιδεύομαι τὸν υἱὸν</span> „I have my son instructed,’’ with c.) such as <i>καλύπτομαι</span> „I wrap myself.’’ Those in c.) are mere reflexives.</p>
    <p>Instance of medial meaning conveyed by medial forms seem to be found especially in the older texts, yet they are not wanting in the classic literature.</p>
    <p>a.) Pâr. 11 4, 12 a marriage-mantra contains the words <skt>paridhatsva vāsaḥ} (put on the garment [yourself]), for <skt>paridhehi} would mean „put it on another;’’ Ait. Br. 2, 11, 1 <skt>devā vai yajñāmatanvata} [for their own benefit]; Kathâs. 42, 201 <skt>avṛnīta kāmārtā taṃ vidyādharakanyakā} (she chose him [for her husband]) and in this meaning regularly <skt>vṛṇute}, f. i. Kumâras. 6, 78; R. 1, 61, 21 <skt>rājaputra nayasva mām} (prince, take me with you); Kathâs. 25, 232 — the king, being presented with a golden lotus, puts it into a silver vase, and says: I would I had another similar lotus to put it into the other silver vase — <skt>āsthāpayiṣye cāmuṣmindvitīye kalaśe’pi tat}; — Pat. I, p. 281 <skt>uttapate pāṇī} (he warms his hands), ibid. p. 282 <skt>āyacchate pāṇī} (he stretches his hands); — Panc. 64 <skt>rājño’ntaḥ puraṃ jalakrīḍāṃ kurute} (the king’s zenana are sporting in the water); Mhbh. 1, 175, 33 <skt>sā gauḥ… viśvāmitrasya tatsainyaṃ vyadrāvayata sarvaśaḥ}.</p>

    <p>c.) Âpast. 1, 6, 3 <skt>na cainam abhiprasārayīta} (he shall not stretch out [his feet] towards him); Mhbh. 1, 121, 31 <skt>darśayaśva naravyāghra} (show yourself, gallant prince); R. 1, 75, 3 <skt>mahaddhanuḥ / pūrayasva śareṇaiva svabalaṃ darśayasva ca}.</p>

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. P. 1, 3, 68 teaches the use of the medial causatives <skt>bhīṣaye} and <skt>vismāpaye} when meaning: »I cause [you] to fear (wonder at) myself,’’ whereas the regular forms <skt>bhāyayati}, <skt>vismāyayati} have no reflexive meaning.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. Reciprocity may be denoted by compound verbs beginning by <skt>vyati-}. These must be generally medial verbs. See P. 1, 3, 14-16 and Pat. I, p. 277.</p>
