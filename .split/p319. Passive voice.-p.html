    <p>319. Passive voice.</p>
    <p>The <<b>>passive voice</span> is much used in Sanskrit both personally and impersonally, as has been pointed out 7 and 8. {P. 3, 1, 87.}</p>
    <p>Moreover it serves to signify such intransitive actions as <i>the rice balls</span>, <i>the wood splits</span> <skt>pacyata odanam / bhidyate kāṣṭham}(*1), whereas ,,I boil the rice, I split the wood’’ is expressed by the active voice <skt>odanaṃ pacāmi / kāṣṭhaṃ bhinadmi}(*2). Pat. II, p.14 <skt>kulasya pipatiṣato loṣṭāḥ śīryante} (from a river-bank, which is about to give way, lumps of earth are breaking off), Kumâras. 4, 5 <skt>na vidīrye} (v. a. my heart does not break); Kathâs. 25, 45 <skt>vahanaṃ samabhajyata} (the vessel burst), Çat. Br. 1, 5, 4, 5 <skt>pra vanaspatīnāṃ phalāni mucyante} (the fruits fall down from the trees). Of the kind are <skt>dṛśyate} (to appear, to seem), <skt>upacoyate} (to increase), <skt>apacīyate} (to decrease), <skt>yujyate} (to suit, to be fit) and the like.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. It is not allowed, however, to use that intransitive passive of all verbs. Pâṇini excepts the roots <skt>duh}, <skt>snu} and <skt>nam}. {P. 3, 1, 88.} One says <skt>dugdhe} — not <skt>duhyate} — <skt>gauḥ svayameva}, <skt>namate} — not <skt>namyate} — <skt>daṇḍaḥ svayameva} »the cow is milking; the stick bends.’’ Patanjali extends the exception to others, especially to all causatives, and mentions a vârttika of the Bhâradvâjîyas which enumerates even a larger list of exceptions. This statement of the Bhâradvâjîyas has been accepted by the Kâçikâ. At all events, this much is certain, that of several verbs the medial voice has also an intrans. meaning. A concurrence of medial and passive is taught by P. 3, 1, 62 and 63 for the aorist of roots ending in a vowel and also of <skt>duh}; with intransitive meaning it may be said <skt>akāri} or <skt>akṛta}, <skt>adohi} and <skt>adugdha}, f. i. <skt>akāri} or <skt>akṛta kaṭaḥ svayameva}.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the pure reflexive — 318 <i>c</span>) — is occasionally expressed by a passive; especially <skt>mucyate} ,,to release one’s self.’’ R. 3, 69, 39 <skt>parimucyasva rāghava}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Note the idiom <skt>tapyate tapastāpasaḥ}, a passive with etymological object. {P. 3, 1, 89.} See f. i. M. 2, 167.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>The passive, when personal, is styled <skt>karmaṇi} (expressive of the object), when impersonal, <skt>bhāve} (express. of the state), see P. 1, 3, 13; 3, 1, 67. When having an intransitive or reflexive meaning, it is styled <skt>karmakartari} (express. of both subject and object).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>Yet one likewise says f. i. <skt>sādhu sthālī pacati} (the pot boils well), cp. Kâç. on P, 3, 1, 87.</p>
