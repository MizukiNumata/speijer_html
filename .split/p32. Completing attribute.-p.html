    <p>32. Completing attribute.</p>
    <p>IV. — The <b>noun wanted for completing the predicate</span> is used in many idioms, the most important of which are:</p>

    <p>{a.) a nominative.}</p>
    <p>a.) it is a nominative, when accompanying verbs of <i>being, seeming, becoming, growing, remaining,</span> such passives as <i>to be called, held for, considered, appointed, made</span>, sim. Çâk. I <skt>mṛga eṣa viprakṛṣṭaḥ saṃpannaḥ} (this deer has become distant), Hitop. 92 <skt>pakṣiṇaḥ sakopā babhūvuḥ} (the birds grow angry), Panc. 51 <skt>kim evaṃ tvam akasmād vicetanaḥ} (why you have swooned so at a sudden?) ; Priy. p.14 <skt>kasmāt prahṛṣṭa iva lakṣyase} (why do you look so glad?) Panc. 56 <skt>sa rājā prākāraśeṣaḥ kṛtaḥ} (the king was reduced to the possession of nothing but his fortress), Panc. III, 152 <skt>gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate} (it is the wife that is called one’s »home”).</p>

    <p>{b.) an instrumental.}</p>
    <p>b) it is an instrumental, if wanted by a verb of <i>being, becoming, seeming</span> etc. when impersonal passive In this case both subject and noun-predicate are put in the instrumental. Mudr. I <skt>mayā na śayānena sthīyate} = <skt>ahaṃ na śayānas tiṣṭḥāmi}; Daçak. 18 <skt>bālakena sakalakleśasahenābhāvi} (the baby was strong enough to endure all this toil).</p>
    <p>This idiom is, of course, obligatory with the krtya’s of it. Daçak. 164 <skt>tvad anujīvinā rājaputreṇa bhavitavyam} (the prince deserves to be your attendant), Panc. 21 <skt>tasya ca śabdānurūpeṇa parākrameṇa bhavitavyam}<i> </span>(and his strength may be adequate to his voice).</p>

    <p>{c.) an accusative.}</p>
    <p>c.) an accusative, when qualifying the object of the verbs of <i>calling</span> and <i>naming</span>, of <i>esteeming</span>, <i>holding for</span>, <i>considering</span>, <i>knowing as</span>, of <i>making</span>, <i>appointing</span>, <i>electing</span> and the like. M. 2, 140 <skt>tam ācāryaṃ pracakṣate} (him they call a teacher), Nala 3, 22 <skt>nalaṃ māṃ viddhi} (know me being Nala), Mudr. III <skt>kaurilyo nṛpatim akaron mauryakṛṣalam} (Cânakya has made king a çûdra, the soil of Murâ), Pat. I, p.332 <skt>taṇḍulān odanam pacati} (he boils rice to a jelly), Panc. 3 <skt>etān arthaśāstraṃ prati drāg yathān anyasadṛśān vidadhāsi tathā kuru}.</p>

    <p>{Concurrent idiom}</p>
    <p>NB. It is superfluous to give some more instances of that well-known type, but it must be observed, that Sanskrit has also other concurrent idioms, it often prefers. Note in the first place, the nominative with <skt>iti}, 2ly the instrumental of abstract nouns. Both are equivalent to the nomin. or accus. of the completing predicate. Instead of <skt>brāhmaṇaṃ bhavantaṃ saṃbhāvayāmi} (I hold you for a brahman), it is also said <skt>brāhmaṇa iti bhava-}<i> </span>or <skt>brāhmaṇatvena bhava-}; the same of course applies to the passive construction. R. 3, 9, 11 <skt>vanaṃ daṇḍakā iti viśrutaṃ prasthitas tvam} (you have set out for the forest, called Daṇḍaka), Kâç. on P. 1, 1, 1 <skt>vṛddhiśabdaḥ saṃjñātvena vidhīyate} (<i>vṛddhi</span> is established [here] a grammatical term). A more detailed account of those idioms will be given in the course of this book.</p>
