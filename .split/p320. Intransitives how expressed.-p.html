    <p>320. Intransitives how expressed.</p>
    <p><<b>>Intransitives</span> are often expressed also by the verbs of the so-called <i>fourth</span> class of conjugation, which chiefly comprises roots with intransitive meaning, as <skt>kruvyati}, <skt>hṛṣyati}, <skt>sadhyati}, <skt>bhraśyati}. For the rest, intransitive meaning is by no means restricted to a special set of forms and may be conveyed by any. So f. i. <skt>svap} ,,to sleep’’ is formally an active <skt>svapiti}, <skt>śo} ,,to lie’’ a medial <skt>śete}, <skt>mṛ} ,,to die’’ a passive <skt>mriyate}.</p>
    <p>The difference of accentuation which exists between the verbs of the 4th class and the passives, must not blind us to the incontestable fact of their close connection. At the outset; there is likely to have been one conjugation in <skt>-yati -yate} with intransitive function, whence both the 4th class and the passive have sprung. Nor is it possible, even in accentuated texts, to draw everywhere with accuracy the boundary-line between them, see Whitney § 761, especially <i>b.</span>) and <i>c.</span>) and 762, cp. also the rule of P. 6, 11 195. — The old language, especially the dialect of the Mahâbhârata, affords many instances of passive forms with the endings of the parasmaipadam, even with passive meaning. See f. i. Mhbh. 1, 24, 15; 38, 13; 51, 9; 102, 23; Nala. 20, 31 etc. (*1).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>P. 3, 1, 90 mentions two roots, which are verbs of the 4th class, parasmaipada, when being used as intransitive-reflexives, whereas they are otherwise conjugated, when transitives. But Pâṇini expressly states that the eastern grammarians teach so, the passive of them may, therefore, be also employed, f. i. <skt>kuṣyati} or <skt>kuṣyate pādaḥ svayameva} (the foot strikes), <skt>rajyati} or <skt>rajyate vastraṃ svayameva} (the garment is dying). Utt. V, p. 102 <skt>netre svayaṃ rajyataḥ}.</p>
