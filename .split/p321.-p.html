    <p>The Sanskrit finite verb comprises the following tenses and moods: 1. <i>the present</span> (<skt>laṭ}), 2. the <i>imperfect</span> (<skt>laṅ}), 3. the <i>perfect</span> (<skt>liṭ}), 4. the <i>aorist</span> (<skt>luṅ}), 5. and 6. the <i>future</span> in <skt>syati} (<skt>lṛṭ}) and the <i>periphrastic future</span> (<skt>luṭ}), 7. the <i>imperative</span> (<skt>loṭ}), 8. the <i>potential</span> or <i>optative</span> (<skt>liṅ}), 9. the <i>precative</span> (<skt>liṅṅāśiṣi}), 10. the <i>conditional</span> (<skt>lṛṅ}). To them we must add for the archaic dialect the <i>conjunctive</span> (<skt>leṭ}), for the classic language the <i>participles in</span> <skt>-ta} and <skt>-tavant}, as far as they do duty for finite verbs. Of these, 1-6 and the said participles constitute that, which we are wont to call „the indicative mood;’’ the other moods are represented by 7-10 and by the <skt>leṭ}.</p>
    <p>Vernacular grammar makes no distinction between tenses and moods, which is, indeed, less developed in Sanskrit, than it is in Latin and Greek. (*1)</p>

    <p>ln Pâṇinî grammar the 10 or 11 tenses and moods form <i>one</span> category, but do not bear a common appellation. The <i>Kâtantra</span> names them <skt>vibhakti}, by the same term which is used for the »cases’’ of the nouns. See Kât. 3, 1, 11-34 with commentary.</p>
