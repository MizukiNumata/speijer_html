    <p>Of the tenses, which constitute the indicative mood, the present is represented by <i>one</span>, the future by <i>two</span>, the past by <i>four</span> (aorist, imperfect,, perfect, participles). Of the two futures, that in <skt>-syati} is the general exponent of the future. Likewise the aorist and the participles are the general exponents of the past. The other past tenses and the other future have but a limited sphere of employment. We may remark that those limits are quite different from what one would expect judging from the names, by which Sanskrit tenses have been termed by European scholars. Sanskrit imperfect and perfect have nothing in common with their cognominal tenses in Latin or French or Greek, and the difference f. i between the employment of Skr. <skt>lekhitāsmi} and <skt>lekhiṣyāmi} can in no way be compared with that which exists between Lat. <i>scripturus sum</span> and <i>scribam</span>.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Sanskrit makes no distinction between absolute and relative tenses. Hence, if one wants to denote what <i>was</span> about to be done in the past (*1), one employs the same tense which is expressive of what is about to be done now, viz. the future. Similarly, the same past tenses, which signify that which is accomplished now, may serve also for the expression of the action, which will be accomplished at some future point of time. Nâgân. III, p. 55 <skt>priye gaccha tvamātmano mṛham aham api mitrāvasuṃ dṛṣṭvā tvaritamāgata eva}, here the past tense <skt>āgataḥ} has the value of the so-called futurum exactum of Latin, <i>ego advenero</span>.</p>
    <p>For this reason too, the present does also duty for the dura­tive of the past (327) and the past tenses are also significative of the remote past (339).</p>

    <p>This was at the outset the duty of the so-called conditional, but in classic Sanskrit this employment having fallen out of use, it is the future that is to express <i>scripturus eram</span> as well as <i>scripturus sum</span>. Cp. 847 R.</p>
