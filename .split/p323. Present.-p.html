    <p>323. Present.</p>
    <p>The <b>present tense</span> is in Sanskrit what it is everywhere, the expression of facts present or represented as such. The notion „present” has of course the utmost elasticity. It applies to any sphere of time of which ourselves are the centre and it may have as small or as great a periphery as possible. Accordingly, facts which are represented as happening always and everywhere are put in the present. It is superfluous to illustrate this by examples.</p>
