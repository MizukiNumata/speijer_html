    <p>324. Present, denoting a near future.</p>
    <p>Further, the present may denote a near past or a near future. {P. 3, 3, 131.}</p>
    <p>1. The <i>present denoting a near future</span> may be compared with such phrases as: I am going on a journey next week, instead of: I shall go. {P. 3, 3, 5 and 6.} So <skt>kadā bhuṅkte} = <skt>kadā bhokṣyate} etc.</p>
    <p>Bhoj. 42 <skt>yadi na gamyate śvo rājasevakā asmān niḥsārayanti} (if we do not go, the king’s attendants will tum us out to-morrow), R. 3, 68, 13 <skt>kṣiprameva vinaśyati} (he will die, soon), Panc. 143 <skt>dhanyo’haṃ yaddhavatā saha tatra kālaṃ nayāmi} (I am happy, I shall pass the time there with you).</p>
    <p>In subordinate sentences the present is very often employed in this manner, especially in final and consecutive clauses, as will be shown afterwards.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Pâṇini gives a special rule concerning the present denoting the future with <skt>yāvat} and <skt>purā}. {P. 3, 3, 4.} Example of <skt>yāvat}: Panc. 286 <skt>etau yatnena rakṣaṇīyau yāvad ahaṃ samāgacchāmi} (— till I come back). As to <skt>purā}, it may be 1. an adverb »erelong.’’ 2. a conjunction = Lat. <i>priusquam</span>. The rule holds good for both. Daç. 186 <skt>kṣiṇoti ca purā sa kṛtaghno bhavantam} (and that ungrateful man will erelong kill you); R. 2, 116, 19 <skt>purā… śārīrīmupahiṃsāṃ tapasviṣu / darśayanti hi duṣṭāste tyakṣyāma imamāśramam} {before those wicked beings inflict any corporal injury upon the ascets, we will leave this hermitage).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Another consequence of its fitness for denoting a near future is exhibited by its doing duty for a conjunctive (356).</p>
