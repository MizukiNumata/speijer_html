    <p>Utt. I, p. 3 <skt>dharmāsanādviśti vāsagṛhaṃ narendraḥ} (the king has just retired from his seat of justice to bis inner apartments). — Of this kind are the rules given by Pâṇini (3, 2, 120 and 121) for the employment of present and aorist in answers. If one asks »have you made the mat?’’, the answer may be, when using <skt>na}, <skt>na karomi} or <skt>nākārṣam} »no, I have not,’’ or if an interrogation, »have I not?’’ Likewise with <skt>nu}, <skt>ahaṃ nu karomi} or, <skt>nv akārṣam}. But with <skt>nanu} exclusively the present: <skt>nanu karomi} »indeed, I have.’’ (*1).</p>
