    <p>328. Actual past and historical past.</p>
    <p>In defining the employment of the past tenses one must distinguish between such past facts, as have not lost their actuality, and such as have, and therefore belong to history. The historical past may be expressed by any past tense, but the actual past not. In other terms, as a rule, English <i>he did</span> and <i>he had done</span> may be rendered by Sanskrit aorist, imperfect, perfect or the participle (<skt>kṛtavān}, <skt>kṛtamanena}), but English <i>he has done</span> only by the aorist or the participle, not by the imperfect or by the perfect.</p>

    <p>{Historical past expressed by any past tense.}</p>
    <p>I. For expressing the <<b>>historical past</span>, the four past tenses are used almost promiscuously, and the historical present (326, 327) may be added to them as a fifth.</p>
    <p>Examples: Kathâs. 24, 10 it is told, one asked (<skt>apṛcchat} imperf.), vs. 11 the other replied (<skt>avādīt} aor.), vs. 13 the former asked again (<skt>papracch} perf.). Ibid. vs. 214 (<skt>bhayānna te / yadā tasyāśakanvaktuṃ dṛtānvisasṛjustadā / te ca… tam abruvan} »as they could not tell it him [themselves], they sent messengers, who told him’’) is an other instance of aor., perf and imperf. used promiscuously and without the slightest difference of meaning. Panc. 276 we have this succession of facts: <skt>bhāryām abhihitavān} (participle)… <skt>ity abhidhāya prāyāsīt} (aorist) / <skt>atha tasyāṃ puṣpavāṭikāyām paṅgurgītam udgirayati} (histor. pres. with durative meaning »was singing)’’, / <skt>tac chrutvā tayābhihitam} (partic.)… <skt>paṅgur abravīt} (imperf.) and so on. In an other story Panc. 51, we have this succession of facts: a weaver and a cartwright dwelled (<skt>prativasataḥ sma}) in the same town and lived always together (<skt>kālaṃ nayataḥ}). One day a great festival took place (<skt>saṃvṛttaḥ}) and a procession, in the midst of which they beheld (<skt>dṛṣṭvantau}) a maiden of great beauty. On seeing her, the weaver fell in love with her and swooned (<skt>sahasā bhūtale nipapāta}). His friend the cartwright got him carried home (<skt>svagṛhamānāyayat}) and by proper treatment he soon recovered (<skt>sacetano babhūva}). — Upon the whole, there seems to be a tendency to alternate the past tenses in literary compositions.</p>
