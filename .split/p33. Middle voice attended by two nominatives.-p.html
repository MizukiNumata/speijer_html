    <p>33. Middle voice attended by two nominatives.</p>
    <p>In the archaic dialect we frequently meet with <i>two nominatives</span> construed with some verbs in the middle voice, viz. such as signify <i>to call one’s self</span>, <i>to consider one’s self</span> (*1). Rgv. 10, 85, 3 <skt>somaṃ manyate papivān} (he thinks himself having drunk <i>soma</span>), Ch. Up. 5, 3, 4 <skt>kim anuśiṣṭo ‘vocathā yo hīmāni na vidhyāt kathaṃ so ‘nuśiṣṭo bravīta} (why did you say you had been instructed? how could anybody, who did not know these things, claim himself instructed?), Tbr. 2, 3, 8, 2 <skt>so ‘surān sṛṣṭvā pitevāmanyata} (he, after having created the asuras considered himself as if he were a father (*2)). — Similarly it is said in liturgical style <skt>rūpaṃ kṛ} with nom, »to assume the shape of — ”, Ait. Br. 6,35,4 <skt>aśvaḥ śveto rūpaṃ kṛtvā} (having assumed a, white horse’s shape), Tbr. 1, 1, 3, 3 <skt>ākhū rūpaṃ kṛtvā} (*3).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In classic Sanskrit this idiom seems to have antiquated. »To call — , to consider one's self” is expressed by means of the reflexive pronoun, as <skt>ātmānaṃ manye / ātmānaṃ bravīmi}. Instead of the old type <skt>aśvo rūpaṃ kṛtvā} we meet with such compounds as Panc. 326 <skt>aśvarūpaṃ kṛtvā}</p>

    <p>This nominative has its counterpart in Greek and in modern languages. So says an illustrious German poet (Felix Dahn, <i>Skaldenkunst</span> p. 79) »weise wähnt’ ich mich, und ach! ein Thor, ein pflichtvergessner Knabe erwies ich mich.”</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>In a few passages of the upanishads and epic poetry we meet with such expressions a <skt>paṇḍitaṃ manyamānaḥ} »holding one’s self a learned man,” for ex. Mhbh. 13, 22, 13. They are hardly to be accepted as compounds, like [paṇḍitaṃmanya], [subhagaṃmanya] and the like (P. 3, 2, 83).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>See the amount of examples in Weber, Ind, Stud. XIII, 111. — Ait. Br. 5, 7, 2 we have a confusion of the two constructions, the acc. of the pronoun <skt>ātmānam} being used together with the nom. of the noun <skt>indro vā etābhir mahān ātmānaṃ niramimīta}.</p>
