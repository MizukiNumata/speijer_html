    <p>330. Difference between imperfect and perfect.</p>
    <p>There is, however, a difference between the perfect and the imperfect. {P. 3, 2, 115.} It is taught by Pâṇini in express terms, that <i>the perfect</span> (<skt>liṭ}) <i>is restricted to such facts as have not been witnessed by the speaker</span>, and the practice of good authors is generally in accordance with this statement. It is somewhat uncommon to meet with a perfect when expressive of an action the speaker has witnessed himself.</p>
    <p>Good authors, accordingly, avoid using the perfect tense, if the facts narrated have been witnessed by the speaker. The <i>Daçakumâracarita</span> abounds in stories of adventures, told by the very persons who have experienced them; all past tenses are employed promiscuously, only perfects are wanting. But, in the same work, if the author himself is speaking, or if any of his heroes is relating a fable of olden times, the perfects make their appearance side by side with the other past tenses (*1). The same observation may be made with respect to the <i>Kathâsaritsâgara</span> (*2).</p>
    <p>Yet, from this one must not infer, that on the other hand the imperfect is <i>restricted</span> to the relation of past facts witnessed by the speaker (*3). Even, if Pâṇini had taught so (*4), such a rule would be in direct opposition to the constant practice of Sanskrit literature up to the Vedas. The imperfect is always and everywhere used both of past facts which are within the compass of the speaker’s experience, and of those which are not.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. In putting questions, the difference between perfect and imperfect vanishes, and it seems, also that between those tenses and the aorist. If I rightly understand P. 3, 2, 117, the employment of both perf. and imperf. in putting questions is prescribed by Pâṇini, even if the past action be »near in time’’ <skt>āsannakāle}. Kâç. exemplifies this rule <skt>kaścit kaṃcit pṛcchati / agacchad devadattaḥ / jagāma devadattaḥ}. R. 3, 19, 6 Khara asks his sister Çûrpaṇakhâ <skt>ko’yam evaṃ mahāvīryas tvāṃ virūpāṃ cakāra ha} (what strong man has disfigured you thus?). Cp. Ch. Up. 4, 14, 2 quoted 346.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Another rule of Pâṇini — 3, 3, 135 — forbids the imperfect, the perfect and the present with <skt>sma} (*5) in two cases: <skt>kriyāprabandhasāmīpyayoḥ}. According to the gloss of the Kâçikâ <i>kriyâprabandha</span> is »uninterrupted action,’’ <i>sâmîpya</span> »the time which immediately adjoins the time of the speaker.’’ In these cases the aorist and the participles are stated to be employed, not the other past tenses. Kâç. gives these examples <skt>yāvaj jīvamannamadāt} (as long as he lived he distributed food [to the poor]), <skt>yeyaṃ paurṇamāsyatikrāntaitasyāmupādhyāyo’gnīnādhita} (at the next full moon the teacher worshipped the holy fires). I do not know how far this injunction is confirmed by the evidence furnished by Sanskrit literature. For the rest cp. 341 R.</p>

    <p>So there is not a single perfect in the whole story of Apahâravarma, as he relates his own adventures; for the same reason perfects are wanting in the stories of other princes. The sixth ucchvâsa, <i>Mitraguptacaritam</span>, has no perfects, while Mitragupta tells all what has happened to himself, but as soon as he is narrating to the giant the four little tales of Dhûminî etc., perfects abound.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>Exceptions may, however, occasionally be found. Daç. 110 and 111 prince Upahâravarma, when relating his own adventures, says twice <skt>ruroda}, while speaking of a woman, who wept before his eyes. R. 3, 67, 20 the vulture Jaṭâyu informs Râma, how Râvaṇa <skt>sītāmādāya vaidehīmutpapāta vihāyasam}, Kathâs. 6, 43 the clever merchant, who has made his fortune by trade, uses the perfect <skt>dadau}, while relating, that each woodcutter gave him two pieces of wood, as he presented them with a fresh draught. Likewise Nagân. V, p. 77 <skt>papāta} instead of the aor. of a fall, which the speaker has seen on the same day and with his own eyes. But, I repeat, such deviations are upon the whole very rare, at least in good authors.</p>

    <p>The term <skt>parokṣe} for the sphere of the perfect, is a point of dispute with the commentators. It is asked, what kind of actions may be said to fall under this category, and as the term, when strictly interpreted, signifies »beyond the reach of the eye,’’ it has been deemed necessary to give an additional rule in express terms, that »well-known facts falling within the speaker’s sphere of observation are to be put in the imperfect — not in the perfect — even if they have in fact not been witnessed by him.’’ This vârttika seems to be as old as Kâtyâyana, it is expounded by Pat. II, p. 119.</p>

    <p>It is not quite sure, that he has. Still, when looking closely at Pâṇini’s own words about the employment of <skt>laṅ} and <skt>liṭ} and at the commentaries and disputes of his scholiasts, we may consider it a tenet of the grammarians, that <skt>laṅ} is not available within the sphere set apart for <skt>liṭ}. From 3, 2, 116 <skt>haśaśvator laṅ ca} »with <skt>ha} and <skt>śaśvat} (forsooth) — cp. 397 R. 3 — <skt>laṅ} may also be used within the sphere or <skt>liṭ}’’, cp. s. 115, we can draw no other inference, than even this, that in any other case one would be wrong in using <skt>laṅ parokṣe}. But it is possible, that this sûtra 116 did not belong to the original work of Pâṇini. Indeed setting this sûtra apart, the very arrangement of the rules which treat of the suffixes and tenses of the past, would rather induce us to suppose Pâṇini having taught the employment of <skt>laṅ} both <skt>aparokṣe} and <skt>parokṣe}. From 3, 2, 84 up to 123 <skt>bhūte} is adhikâra, the suffixes taught there are accordingly expressive of »the past.’’ Now, from 84-110 this »past’’ is not specialized and comprises <i>any past whatever</span>. With s. 111 the first restriction makes its appearance, it is stated that the imperfect (<skt>laṅ}) is used <skt>anadyatane} »denoting the not-actual past.’’ From there <skt>anadyatane} remains adhikâra till s. 119, but s. 115 a second restriction is added to the first: the suffixes are not only expressive of the past <skt>anadyatane} but also <skt>parokṣe}. Now the question is simply this: Has Pâṇini meant sûtra 111 (employment of <skt>laṅ}) to be an <i>exception</span> to 110 (employment of <skt>luṅ} »aorist’’) and likewise 115 (employment of <skt>liṭ}) an <i>exception</span> to 111 — or is each of these rules to be interpreted separately and considered by itself? According to the former acceptation, the aorist is taught to be <i>restricted</span> to past actions that have happened to-day, the imperfect <i>restricted</span> to past actions before to-day, but witnessed by the speaker; according to the latter, the aorist is expressive of any past both actual and historical, and the imperfect of any historical past both witnessed and not-witnessed by the speaker. The former acceptation is that of Sanskrit grammarians up to Patanjali and the author of the vârttikas, the latter is in accordance with the practice of Sanskrit literature.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*5)</p>
    <p>Though not mentioned either by Kâç. or by Patanjali, the <skt>liṭ} and the <skt>laṭ sme} must needs be implied in the prohibition, for the adhikâra <skt>anadyatane} implies them too.</p>
