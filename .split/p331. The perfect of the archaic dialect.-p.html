    <p>331. The perfect of the archaic dialect.</p>
    <p>At the outset, the perfect had not the restricted function, which it has in the classic dialect.</p>

    <p>{Perfect, when a present tense.}</p>
    <p>In the old vedic mantras, like the aorist, it may denote every shade of the past, and occasio­nally it has even the power of a present tense, in the same way as for instance Greek <i>ἕστηχα οἶδα</span>, Latin <i>memini consuevi</span>, Gothic <i>vait mag</span>, sim. So Rgv. 5, 60, 3 <skt>bibhāya} »is afraid,’’ ibid. 1, 113, 3 <skt>tasthatuḥ} »they stand still’’ and the other instances to be found in Delbrück <i>Altindische Tempuslehre</span> p. 103 sqq.</p>
    <p>The classic language has but two perfects, expressive of the present, viz. <skt>veda} (he knows) and <skt>āha} (he says); the latter may also be used of the past. (*1) From the liturgical writings — where, for the rest, the employment of the perfect is already confined within the same limits as afterwards, see Delbrück <i>l. l.</span> p. 131 — we may adduce moreover <skt>īśe} »he rules’’ (f. i. Ait. Br. 1, 30, 3), <skt>jagāra} »he is awake’’ Ch. Up. 4, 3, 6 and perhaps some others, see f. i. Ait. Br. 2, 41, 4.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>My notes contain, however, two other instances. Panc. 246 <skt>ājagāma} is used in the sense of Greek <i>ἥκω</span>. The serpent declares to the frogs <skt>tato ‘haṃ yuṣmākaṃ vāhanārtham ājagāma} (by this [viz. the curse of the brahman, whose son he had bitten to death] I have come to you in order to be your carrier). In the Gaurî recension of the Çâkuntala, V, p. 109 of the 2d ed. of Tarkavâgîça (Calc. 1864) Çârngarava says to Dushyanta <skt>yanmithaḥ samayādimāṃ madīyāṃ duhitaraṃ bhavānupayeme tanmayā prītimatā yuvayor anujñātam}. In both instances the perfect is rather expressive of an action finished, than of an action past.</p>
