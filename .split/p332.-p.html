    <p>From the above it is sufficiently clear, that the 1st and 2d person of the perfect are hardly met with in classic Sanskrit, except of <skt>veda} and <skt>āha}. — For the 1st person, Patanjali is at a loss, how to employ it, unless to relate facts done while being asleep or drunk. (*1) That the 2d person of the plural is not used, is evident from a passage of the commencement of the <i>Mahâbhâshya</span>; there it is observed, that such forms as <skt>ūṣ}, <skt>tera}, <skt>cakra}, <skt>peca} exist in theory only, as one does not say <skt>kva ūṣa} but <skt>kva yūyam uṣitāḥ}. See Pat. I, p. 8, 1. 23; p. 9, 1. 11.</p>

    <p>The example given is <skt>matno} — or <skt>supno} — <skt>’haṃ kila vilalāpa}. — Another case of its employment is in strong denials, as when one asks <skt>dakṣiṇāpathaṃ praviṣṭo’si} and the other answers <skt>nāhaṃ dakṣiṇāpathaṃ praviveśa}. — See vârtt. on P. 3, 2, 115 in Patanj. II, p. 120, the instance given there is evidently a quotation from some literary work.</p>
