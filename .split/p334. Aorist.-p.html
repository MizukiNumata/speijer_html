    <p>334. Aorist.</p>
    <p>II. The <<b>>aorist</span> (<skt>luṅ}) is expressive of any past, either historical or actual; <skt>akārṣam} may be = „I did,’’ and = „I have done.’’ Examples of the historical aorist have been given 328.</p>
    <p>When denoting the actual past, that is such past acts as are so recent as not to have lost their actuality at the time of their being related, the aorist is used side by side with the participles in <skt>-tavant} and <skt>-ta}; neither imperf. nor perfect are then available. „I have seen the man’’ is <skt>adrākṣaṃ puruṣam} or <skt>dṛṣṭavān asmi} [not <skt>apaśyam} nor <skt>dadarśa}].</p>
    <p>Examples of the aorist denoting the actual past. Ait. Br. 1, 6, 11 <skt>tasmād ācakṣāṇam āhur adrāgiti / sa yady adarśam ity āhāthāsya śraddadhati} (for this reason, one says to an eye-witness: have you seen it? for if he says »he has,’’ they believe him); R. 2, 89, 5 Bharata has spent the night with Guha, the next morning his host asks him <skt>kañcitsukhaṃ nadītīre ‘vātsīḥ kākutstha śarvarīm} (have you past the night well?); Mhbh. 1, 167, 23 king Drupada having lost half his kingdom to Drona, goes to some brahman, who may procure him a means for avenging himself, and says <skt>droṇaḥ parājaiṣṭa mām}; Daç. 27: it has been predicted to the brahman Mâtanga that he will soon meet with a prince, now, when he really meats with a prince, he tells him this prediction and adds these words <skt>tadādeśānuguṇameva bhavadāgamanamabhūt} [neither <skt>abhavat} nor <skt>babhūva} are here admissible]; Çâk. VII Mâtali congratulates Dushyanta on finding back his wife with his son, the king replies <skt>abhūtsaṃpāditasvāduphalo me manārathaḥ} (my desire is gone into sweet fulfilment); Kathâs. 40, 108 <skt>tubhyaṃ mayā rājyamadāyi} (v. a. I have made you king); Panc. 16 the jackal begs permission to appear before the lion, the doorkeeper grants it him with the words <skt>yathāvādīddhavān} (*1).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the archaic dialect of the brâhmaṇas etc. the aorist seems to serve <i>exclusively</span> for this actual past (*2). The contrast between the historical tenses and the aorist is so striking there that it cannot possibly be overlooked by anybody who peruses these writings. The most instructive passages are such, as mention the same fact twice, first when told by the author, afterwards when put into the mouth of one of the actors. Then we invariably find the imperfect or the perfect in the historical account, the aorist in the <i>oratio directa</span>. Ait. Br. 7, 14, 5 <skt>tasya ha dantā jajñire / taṃ hovācājñata vā asya dantāḥ… tasya ha dantāḥ pedire / taṃ hovācāpatsyatā vā asya dantāḥ} (then he got teeth; then he said to him: »he has, indeed, got teeth’’… then his teeth dropped out, then he said to him: »his teeth, have, indeed, dropped out’’). Ch. Up. 5, 3 the following story is told: Çvetaketu once came (<skt>eyāya}) to the meeting of the Pancâlas. To him the xattriya Pravâhaṇa said (<skt>uvāca}): »has your father instructed you?’’ (<skt>anu tvāśiṣatpitā}) (*3). The other answered: »yes, Sir.’’ Then Pr. put five questions to him successively, none of which he could solve, and said: »why have you said (<skt>avocathāḥ}) yourself instructed, as you do not know these things?’’ Then Çvetaketu, being sad with grief, came (<skt>eyāya}) to his father and said (<skt>uvāca}): »why did you say (<skt>bhagavān abravīt}) I have instructed you (<skt>anu tvāśiśam}), a simple xattriya has put (<skt>aprākṣīt}) five questions to me and I could not (<skt>nāśakam}) answer even one.’’ So in the story of Uçasti Câkrâyaṇa Ch. Up. 1, 10 etc. the perfect is used while the author himself is speaking, but 1, 11, 2 when the king excuses himself to Uçasti, that he has not chosen him to be his officiating priest, the aorist appears <skt>bhagavantaṃ vā aham ebhiḥ sarvair ārtvijyaiḥ paryaiśiṣaṃ bhagavato vā ahamavittyānyānavṛṣi} (I have looked for you, for all these sacrificial offices, but not finding (*4) Your Reverence, I have chosen others). Cp. ibid. 6, 13, 1 etc. Delbrück, <i>Altindische Tempuslehre</span> p. 117 etc. has given a great number of instances from the Çatapatha and the Aitareya.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>We may translate here the aorist by a present: »as you say.’’ Cp.</p>
    <p>Çâk. II, p. 38 ed. Tarkavâgîça <skt>sakhe tācad enāṃ na jānāsi yena tvamevamavādīḥ} (you do not know her, since you speak thus). Cp. Greek <i>τί ἐγέλᾰσᾰς</span> »why do you laugh?’’ and the like.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>Delbrück <i>Altind. Tempusl.</span> p. 128 »Niemals steht der Aorist [in this kind of works] im erzählendem Sinne, wie etwa das Imperf. oder Perf.’’ Yet, Ait. Br. 2, 23, 3 the aor. <skt>akrata} is, indeed, used in a historical sense.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>Such passages as this plainly show, methinks, that the system of the grammarians, according to which »past facts done <i>on the same day</span> as they are related’’ must be put in the aorist, but when done before that day, in the imperfect (reap. perfect), is refuted by the very facts.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*4)</p>
    <p>Construe <skt>bhagavato… avittyā}, instr. of <skt>avitti}. The reading is good, and needs no correction.</p>
