    <p>The aorist is used throughout Sanskrit literature in both its acceptations, actual and historical. Instances of the historical aorist occur as early as the Ṛgvedasanhitâ, though, I confess, not many are recorded (*1); and afterwards it is no less frequent than the other historical tenses. For the rest, it may be observed that in easy proseworks and in compositions of rather simple style, the aorist is comparatively rare, and mostly limited to certain verbs often occurring, as <skt>abhūt}, <skt>agamat}, <skt>avādīt}. Yet, in more elegant style, in the works of such writers as Daṇḍin, Bâna, Somadeva, the aorist is employed as often and with as much ease as the other past tenses. (*2).</p>

    <p>A prayer-book, indeed, is not the fittest document from which to learn the historical style of a language. In epic poetry the historical aorist is common.</p>

    <p>For this reason, l am astonished at the statement of Whitney (§ 582 of his Sanskrit grammar), that the aorist is »seldom’’ employed in classic Sanskrit.</p>
