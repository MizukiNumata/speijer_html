    <p>336. The participles in -ta and -tavant doing duty as a past tense.</p>
    <p>The <<b>>participles of the past</span> in <skt>-ta} and <skt>-tavant} may do the same duty as the aorist, whether they are attended by the verb substantive, or without it (9). They are expressive of facts done, finished, and it makes no difference, whether these facts belong to the historical past or have been done of late and have not yet lost their actuality. In both acceptations they are of the utmost frequency. They represent the younger idiom, the aorist the elder one. (*1) Accordingly they are rarely, if at all, thus employed in the archaic dialect. (*2).</p>

    <p>I do not recollect having met with them doing duty as finite verbs, in brâhmaṇas and upanishads. But, as I have not yet made a special inquiry into this subject, I refrain from affirming their entire absence from that class of works.</p>
