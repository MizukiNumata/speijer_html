    <p>338. Old participles of the past.</p>
    <p>The old and genuine participles of the perfect, as <skt>tasthivān} (f. <skt>tasthuṣī}) or <skt>cakrāṇaḥ}, had the same function as those in <skt>-tavant} and <skt>-ta}, which have almost wholly superseded them in the classic dialect (359, 2°). In the epic poems and in kâvyas several of them — at least in the active voice — also do duty as finite verbs; they are then expressive both of the actual past, as R. l, 58, 2 <skt>upeyivān} (you have gone to —) and the historical, as R. 2, 12, 6 <skt>narādhipaḥ / mohamāpedivān}. Cp. Kathâs. 35, 41 and Çiçup. 1, 16.</p>
