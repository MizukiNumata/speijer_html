    <p>339. Remote past.</p>
    <p>Sanskrit lacks a special tense for the so-called re­mote past or plusquamperfectum. The general past tenses are used even then. It must accordingly be inferred exclusively from the context, in what case a Skr. past tense answers to our »remote past.’’ That f. i. Kathâs. 25, 180 the words <skt>yatraiva tamavāptavān… tatraiva} mean »on the very spot, where he <i>had</span> got it,’’ can only be shown by reproducing the whole story, from which they are quoted. — R. 2, 26, 3 Râma has told his mother the cruel order he has just received from his father, to retire into the forest; now he goes to Sîtâ, who did not know anything about it <skt>vaidehī cāpi tatsarvaṃ na śuśrāva tapasvinī} (the unhappy princess <i>had</span> not yet <i>heard</span> anything of it). — Daç. 92 <skt>sa khalu vimardakaḥ… tadahareva prātiṣṭhata} = »Vimardaka <i>had</span> indeed already <i>departed</span> that very day.’’ It is plain, that gerunds are especially fit to signify the remote past.</p>
