    <p>340. Future in -tâ.</p>
    <p>Sanskrit has two future tenses, 1. the so-called periphrastic future (<skt>luṭ}): <skt>kartāsmi}, 2. the future made with <skt>-sya-} (<skt>lṛṭ}): <skt>kariṣyāmi}.</p>
    <p>The former is a compound tense, being made up of a noun in <skt>-tṛ} + a formal element, expressive of the person, signified either by the auxiliary (<skt>asmi} etc:), or by the personal pronoun (*1): Yet for the third person neither is wanted and the simple noun in <skt>-tṛ} may suffice: one says <skt>kartāsmi} or <skt>kartāham}, <skt>kartāsi} or <skt>kartā tvam}, but in the 3d person the simple <skt>kartā} is available. In the dual and in the plural <skt>-tā} remains unchanged, when attended by the auxiliary, therefore <skt>kartāsvaḥ}, <skt>kartāsmaḥ}, but in the 3d person <skt>kartārau}, <skt>kartāraḥ}, and of course also <skt>kartārāvāvām}, <skt>kartāro vayam}, sim. Both pronouns and auxiliaries are occasionally severed from the verbal noun; the pronouns may precede as well as follow. Even the auxiliary sometimes precedes in poetry.</p>
    <p>Examples: 1st and 2d person: Kathâs.26, 31 <skt>gantāsmi} (I shall go), R. 3, 69, 40 <skt>adhigantāsi vaidehīmacireṇa}, Mâlav. I, p.15 <skt>moktā mādhavasenaṃ tato’ham} (then I shall release M.), R. 2, 118, 10 <skt>tathāvṛttiś ca yātā tvaṃ patiśuśrūṣayā divam} (— you will go to heaven), Mudr. V, p. 175 <skt>pañcaṣairahobhir vayam eva tatra gantāraḥ} (— ourselves shall start), Mhbh. 1, 136, 39 <skt>kiṃ dadāni te / prabūhi rājaśārdṛla kartā hy asmi tathā nṛpa}, ibid. 1, 120, 26 <skt>apatyaṃ guṇasaṃpannaṃ labdhā prītikaraṃ hy asi}.</p>
    <p>3d person: Ch. Up. 4, 6, 1 <skt>agniṣṭe pādaṃ vaktā} (Agni will tell you a fourth part [of it]), Mhbh. I, Paushyap. 56 <skt>aśvinau stuhi / tau devabhiṣjau tvāṃ cakṣuṣmantaṃ kartārau}, Bhojapr. 55 <skt>na jāne yātārastava ripavaḥ kena ca pathā}, Nala. 7, 5 <skt>nalaṃ jetā bhavānhi sahito mayā}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. The future in <skt>-tā} may be also used with a feminine subject — R. 1, 38, 8 <skt>ekā janayitā putram} —, but occasionally the fem. in <skt>-trī} is used, at least <skt>bhavitrī}, see f. i. Kathâs. 35, 105. — Some kṛts in <skt>-in}, fem. <skt>-inī}, especially <skt>bhāvin}, are also significative of a future tense (see 359). Vikram. V, p. 181 <skt>surāsuravimardo bhāvī} (a quarrel between gods and demons will take place).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. The medial endings of this future — or rather, of the auxiliary — are scarcely met with in the archaic dialect (Whitney, <i>Sanskr. Gramm.</span> § 947). In the classic language they seem to be no more employed. Without auxiliary, there is of course no formal distinction between the active and the medial voice. One says <skt>adhyetā} (he will study) from the medial <skt>adhīyate}, Panc. 161 <skt>ahaṃ paritrātā} from <skt>paritrāyate}, as well as f. i <skt>draṣṭā} or <skt>kaktā}. Even a passive meaning may be conveyed by this future. Kirât. 3, 22 <skt>ete… unmūlayitāraḥ kapiketanena} (they will be eradicated by Arjuna), R. 3, 56, 5 <skt>yady ahaṃ… tvayā vai dharṣitā balāt / śayitā tvaṃ hataḥ saṃkhye} (if I shall be violated by you perforce, you will perish in battle). Of such roots, as may have special passive aorists, futures, etc. (316), a special passive form is accordingly available, »he will be killed’’ may be either <skt>hantā} or <skt>ghānitā} »it will be given’’ either <skt>dātā} or <skt>dāyitā}, see Kâç. on P. 6, 4, 62 = II, p. 311 of the Benares-edition.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. Mhbh. 3, 176, 20 this future is construed with an objective genitive <skt>bhūyo draṣṭā tavāsmi} (I shall see you again). Likewise Nâgân. IV, p. 65 <skt>kastrātā tava putraka}, the meaning of which, as appears from the context, is »who will protect you, my son?’’ As a rule, however, the object is put in the accusative.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Pâṇini does not mention the 1st and 2d person formed by simply putting together the noun in <skt>-tā} and the personal pronoun. Accordingly this mode of formation has been excluded from the official paradigms of the periphrastic future. Yet <skt>vaktāham} is quite as correct and as much used as <skt>vaktāsmi}. That Pâṇini left it unnoticed, may be due to his system of explaining grammatical forms. To him <skt>vaktāsmi}, <skt>vaktāsmaḥ} are forms to be dealt with, because by the union of both elements a new word arises, bearing one accent, but <skt>vaktā} + <skt>aham} and the like are units syntactically only, not so from a formal point of view. Hence, to Pâṇini the noun in <skt>-tā} is not even the nomin. of a noun, but a simple stem to which the personal suffixes are to be added. Upon the whole, the information to be got from him about this future, is scanty, see P. 3, 1, 33; 2, 4, 85 and 7, 4, 50-52, cp. Boethlingk’s note on 7, 4, 52.</p>
