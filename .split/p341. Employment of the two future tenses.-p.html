    <p>341. Employment of the two future tenses.</p>
    <p>As regards its function, the tense in <skt>-tā} cannot be used of every future, but only of such actions, as will not occur soon, in other terms which have not yet actuality. {P. 3, 3, 15.} It is, therefore, <i>a remote future</span>. The future in <skt>-syati}, on the other hand, is the <i>general future</span>, and may be used of any future action, whether intended or not, whether actual or remote. Hence, for the future in <skt>-tā} one may everywhere substitute that in <skt>-syati}, but not inversely.</p>
    <p>That the future in <skt>-syati} may express also purpose, intention etc. will be shown hereafter, see 344.</p>
    <p>The grammarians make the same distinction between <skt>lṛṭ} and <skt>luṭ} as between <skt>luṅ} and <skt>laṅ}. Both imperfect (<skt>laṅ}) and <skt>luṭ} are restricted to the <skt>anadyatana} (*1).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The past <skt>anadyatane}, as has been stated above (330 R. 2), is to be expressed by the general past tenses in two cases. {P. 3, 3, 135.} Similarly the future <skt>anadyatane} finds its expression by the <i>general</span> future in <skt>-syati} in the same cases, viz. »uninterrupted action’’ and »the time adjoining immediately that of the speaker,’’ therefore <skt>yāvaj jīvamannaṃ dāsyati} [not <skt>dātā}], <skt>yeyamāmāvāsyāgāminyetasyām upādhyāyo’gnīnādhāsyati} (at the next new moon the teacher will worship the holy fires). Some additional remarks are made by P. 3, 3, 136-138 to exclude <skt>luṭ} in a few other cases; but nothing, he says, prevents the use of <skt>luṭ}, if the time be exactly defined by a word meaning »day’’ or »night.’’ The employment of <skt>luṭ} together with such words is proved, indeed, by instances, drawn from literature.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Commentators explain the term <skt>anadyatane bhaviṣyat} as meaning »future facts, not to happen to-day, but to-morrow and afterwards.’’ According to them, that which will happen to-day cannot be signified by <skt>luṭ}. When exemplifying this tense, they are wont to add <skt>śvaḥ}. The Kâtantra names it even <skt>śvastanī}. Yet, this explication of <skt>anadyatana} is no less narrow as regards the future, as it has been shown to be for the past, see note 1 on p. 249 (330-*4) and note 3 on p. 253 (334-*3) of this book. Nor are instances wanting from literature of <skt>luṭ} denoting facts to happen on the same day. Panc. 161 some bride has been left alone by her bridegroom and the whole marriage-train, who have fled at the threatening approach of a wild elephant; then a young man comes to her rescue, takes her by the hand and says <skt>mā bhaiṣīrahaṃ paritrātā}. Prabodh. VI, p. 134 Purusha exclaims <skt>sāyaṃgṛho munirahaṃ bhavitāsmi sadyaḥ}. Inversely, the other future is used even with <skt>śvaḥ}, f. i. Mâlav. II, p. 46 <skt>tvadīyam upadeśaṃ śvo drakṣyāmaḥ}.</p>
