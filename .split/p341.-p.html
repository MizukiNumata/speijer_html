    <p>In most cases, therefore, it is indifferent, what future is employed. Often both alternate. R. 1, 70, 17 <skt>vaktā… vasiṣṭhaḥ}, but in the following çloka <skt>eṣa vakṣyati vasiṣṭhaḥ}, cp. R. 1, 38, 8 and 2, 8, 22. This alternation is most apparent in conditional sentences; then either <skt>luṭ} is used in both protasis and apodosis (Ait. Br. 1, 27, 1), or in the apodosis only, but <skt>lṛṭ} in the protasis (Kathâs. 28, 131 <skt>so’sya… yadi vakṣyati / tasyāpi bhavitā mṛtyuḥ}), or conversely (Kathâs. 1, 60 <skt>yadā tasmai kathāmimāṃ / puṣpadanta pravaktāsi tadā śāpādvimokṣyase}), or the future in <skt>-syati} in both (Kathâs. 39, 67). In putting questions, in uttering prophecies the future in <skt>-tā} is, indeed, often employed (*1), but the future in <skt>-syati} is even there more frequent.</p>

    <p>Delbrück, <i>Altindische Wortfolge</span> p. 6-8, treats the future in <skt>-tā}, as far as it is employed in the Çatapathabrâhmaṇa. He concludes that it is the »objective future, denoting the certainty of the future fact, apart from any wish or desire on the side of the subject.” Though this will hold good in the majority of cases, it is not always supported by facts. A strong desire, an intention, etc. are occasionally also denoted by <skt>luṭ}. R. 1, 20, 3 Daçaratha offers to Viçvâmitra to fight, himself and his army, against the demons: = <skt>anayā} [viz. <skt>senayā}] <skt>sahito gatvā yoddhā’haṃ tair niśācaraiḥ / … ahameva dhanuṣpāṇirgoptā samaramūrdhani}; when he then adds <skt>yāvat prāṇān dhariṣyāmi tāvad yotsye niśācaraiḥ}, he must needs use the other future, as the action is a permanent one, cp. 341 R.</p>
