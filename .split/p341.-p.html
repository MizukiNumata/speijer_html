    <p>According to the vernacular grammarians the general future in <skt>-syati} may even be expressive of the past in this case, if a verb of <i>remembering</span> be added to the past action related. {P. 3, 2, 112.} The imperfect, then, is forbidden and the future to be employed instead of it. Kâç. gives this instance <skt>abhijānāsi devadatta kaśmīreṣu vatsyāmaḥ}, likewise <skt>smarasi}, <skt>budhyase}, <skt>cetayase… vatsyāmaḥ} = »do you remember, that we dwelled —?’’ But this substitution of the future cannot be, if the action remembered or reminded is introduced by <skt>yat}. A third rule of Pâṇini on this head is explained as allowing both imperf. and future, if the verb of remembering introduces two or more past actions, of which the preparatory action is first named, the main action afterwards. See Pat. II, p. 119.</p>
    <p>Of this strange and rather awkward idiom I know no other instances but those, adduced by grammarians or such authors, as aimed at exemplifying the rules of Pâṇini (*1).</p>

    <p>In fact, I cannot persuade myself, that Pâṇini’s words have been well understood by the commentators. Especially the phrase <skt>abhijñāvacane} is likely to mean something different. If it could be proved, that Pâṇini used <skt>abhijñā} in the sense of »purpose’’ <skt>abhiprāya}, all difficulty of interpretation would he removed. Then, indeed, Pâṇini would simply teach the future in <skt>-syati} doing duty as a future’s past (322 R.), <skt>vakṣyati} = <i>dicturus erat</span>.</p>
