    <p>343. The liṅ (<i>optative</span> or <i>potential</span>) is the general exponent of the subjunctive mood.</p>
    <p>The subjunctive mood finds its general expression in the tense termed <skt>liṅ} by Pâṇini, and which one is wont in Europe to name either <<b>>optative</span> or <<b>>potential</span>, though it is not restricted to the expression of both wishes and possibility. In fact, any shade of meaning, inherent to the Latin conjunctive, may be imported by it. Its manysidedness entails the great variety of its translation. According to sense <skt>kuryām} may be = <i>I can (could) do, I may (might) —, will (would) —, shall (should) —, must do, let me do</span>, sim.</p>

    <p>{Its subdivisions.}</p>
    <p>We may make some main distinctions:</p>
    <p>a.) <skt>liṅ} is used in exhortations and precepts: hortative.</p>
    <p>b.) it is expressive of wishes: optative.</p>
    <p>c.) it is a potential, that is, it may purport a possibility, or a probability, on the other hand also uncertainty and impossibility or improbability.</p>
    <p>d.) it is used in hypothetical sentences.</p>
    <p>e.) it may be used in such relative sentences, as bear a general import.</p>
    <p>f.) it may be used in subordinate sentences expressive of a design or of inevitable consequence.</p>

    <p>{a.) hortative.}</p>
    <p>a.) Ch. Up. 7, 3, 1 <skt>mantrān adhīyīya} (let me study the mantras), <skt>karmāṇi kurvīya} (let me do sacrificial acts) {P. 3, 3, 161.}; Panc. V, 103 <skt>ekaḥ svādu na bhuñjīta naikaḥ supteṣu jāgṛyāt / eko na gacchedadhvānaṃ naikaścāryānpravintayet} (one must not take sweetmeats alone, nor wake alone among sleeping people, nor must one walk alone nor consider one’s affairs alone); Kumâras. 4, 36 <skt>jvalanaṃ… tvarayerdakṣiṇavātavījanaiḥ} (you [Spring] must inflame the fire by the breezes of the southwind); Daç. 152 <skt>eṣā cāhaṃ pituste pādamūlaṃ pratyupasarpeyam} (and now, I might return to your father). — From these examples it appears, that the hortative <skt>liṅ} is expressive of any kind of exhortation. <skt>bhavān adhīyīta} may be = »you must study’’ or »you may,’’ »you might,’’ »you are allowed to study,’’ »it is your duty, the due time —’’ etc. See P. 3, 3, 161; 163; 164 with comm.</p>

    <p>{b.) optative.}</p>
    <p>b.) R. 3, 19, 20 Çûrpaṇakhâ utters this wish <skt>tasyāstayośca rudhiraṃ pibeyamahamāhave} (o, that I might drink their blood). {P. 3, 3, 157 and 159.} To this pure and optative often the particle <skt>api} is added or <skt>api nāma}. Mudr. II, p. 89 <skt>api nāma durātmanaścāṇakyahatakāc candragupto bhidyeta}; R. 2, 43, 9 <skt>apīdānīṃ sa kālaḥ syāt… paśyeyamiha rāghavam} (if that time were already present and I should see Râma here). — The verb of »wishing’’ being added, it may also be put in the <skt>liṅ}. {P. 3, 3, 160.} One says either <skt>icchāmi bhuñjīta bhavān} or <skt>iccheyaṃ bhuñjīta bhavān}. Cp. R. 3, 58, 5.</p>

    <p>{c.) potential.}</p>
    <p>c.) The potential <skt>liṅ} comprises various kinds:</p>
    <p>1. <i>possibility</span> and <i>ability</span>, as Panc. 226 <skt>kadācid ayaṃ brāhmaṇo gośabdena budhyeta} (perhaps this brahman will awake by the lowing of the cows), Mṛcch. VII, p. 238 <skt>paśyeyuḥ kṣitipatayo hi cāradṛṣṭyā} (for princes can see through the eye of their spies), Kathâs. 2, 37 <skt>sakṛcchrutam ayaṃ bālaḥ sarvaṃ cādhārayeddhṛdi} (this boy is able to retain by heart all he has heard but once).</p>
    <p>2. <i>probability</span>. Mṛcch. VIII, p. 268 the rake says <skt>athavā mayi gate nṛśaṃso hanyād enām} (in my absence the cruel man will kill her), Kathâs. 25, 24 <skt>jānīyātsa vṛddho jātu tāṃ purīm} (that old man, methinks, will know that town);</p>
    <p>3. <i>doubt</span>. Çâk. V <skt>kim uddiśya kāśyapena matsakāśamṛṣayaḥ preritāḥ syuḥ} (for what reason may the Reverend K. have sent holy men to me?), Panc. I, 215 <skt>ekaṃ hanyānna vā hanyādiṣurmukto dhanuṣmatā / buddhir buddhimatotsṛṣṭā} (the arrow shot by an archer may hit one individual or may not hit him, but the wit of a witty man hits a [whole] kingdom with its ruler);</p>
    <p>4. in negative and interrogative sentences <skt>liṅ} may express <i>improbability</span> or <i>impossibility</span>. Daç. 92 <skt>nipuṇamanviṣyannopalabdhavān} [sc. <skt>enam}] <skt>kathaṃ vopalabhyeta} (he sought carefully, but did not find him; how could he?), Mṛcch. VII, p. 236 <skt>api prāṇān ahaṃ jahyāṃ na nu tvāṃ śaraṇāgatam} (I had rather forsake my life, than you who are a supplicant to me), R. 2, 37, 32 <skt>loke nahi sa vidyeta yo na rāmamanuvrataḥ};</p>
    <p>5. A special kind is the <skt>liṅ} being employed for asserting one’s power »he may even do this.’’ {P. 3, 2, 154.} R. 3, 49, 3 Râvaṇa boasts <skt>udvaheyaṃ bhujābhyāṃ tu medinīmambare sthitaḥ / āpibeyaṃ samudraṃ ca mṛtyuṃ hanyāṃ raṇe sthitaḥ / arkaṃ tudyāṃ śaraistīkṣṇair vibhindyāṃ hi mahītalam} (I am able to lift up the earth with my arms, drink up the ocean etc.). So often with <skt>api} (or <skt>uta}) see P. 3, 3, 152. — But if one says »he may even do this,’’ in order to express blame on that account, the present is necessary, and the <skt>liṅ} is forbidden (P. 3, 3, 142). Kâç. gives this example <skt>api} — or <skt>jātu} — <skt>tatrabhavān vṛṣalaṃ yājayati} (he is even able to officiate for a çûdra).</p>

    <p>{d.) hypothetical.}</p>
    <p>d.) the hypothetical <skt>liṅ} is used, if it is wanted to say, what will happen or would happen, if some other fact occur or should occur. It is used in the protasis as well as in the apodosis of hypothetical sentences, Mhbh. 1, 82, 21 Çarmishṭhâ says to Yayâti <skt>tvatto’patyavatī loke careyaṃ dharmam uttamam} (if I had offspring from you, I would walk in the highest path of duty), Pat. I, p. 2 <skt>yo hy ajānanvai brāhmaṇaṃ hanyātsurāṃ vā pibetso’pi manye patitaḥ syāt} (for he, who should kill a brahman or drink strong liquor without knowing it, even such a one would be an outcast, methinks), Panc. III, 203 <skt>yadi syāt pāvakaḥ śotaḥ proṣṇo vā śaśalāñchanaḥ / strīṇāṃ tadā satītvaṃ syād yadi durjano hitaḥ}. Cp. 489 and 470 R. 3.</p>

    <p>{e.) liṅ used in relative sentences of general import.}</p>
    <p>e.) <skt>liṅ} used in relative sentences of general import. Âçv. 1, 3, 1 <skt>yatra kva ca hoṣyantsyāt} (wheresoever one has the intention of performing oblations), Panc. I, 165 <skt>kālātikramaṇaṃ vṛtter yo kurvīta bhūpatiḥ / kadācit taṃ muñcanti bhartsitā api sevakāḥ} (the king who duly observes the time of paying the wages to his officials, him —), ibid. I, 271 <skt>ardharājyaharaṃ bhṛtyaṃ na hanyātsa hanyate}.</p>

    <p>{f. liṅ used in final and consecutive clauses.}</p>
    <p>f.) <skt>liṅ} expressive of a design or a consequence. Kathâs. 36, 106 <skt>hariṃ śaraṇamāśraye yena syāṃ naiva duḥkhānāṃ punar bhājanam īdṛśām} (I betake myself to Hari, in order that such grief may never again befall me), R. 3, 13, 11 <skt>ādiśa me deśaṃ… yatra vaseyam}, ibid. 3, 50, 18 <skt>sa bhāraḥ saimya bhartavyo yo naraṃ nāvasādayet} (one must bear only such a burden, as will not exhaust its bearer).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. <skt>mā} — in epic poetry also <skt>na} — with <skt>liṅ} = »lest.’’ Cp. 405 R. 1.</p>
    <p>It needs no argument, that the subdivisions laid down here and other similar ones are somewhat arbitrary. It is one and the same <skt>liṅ} that is involved in all of them, and it is only for the sake of developing the variety of the logical relations, which are signified by that so-called ,,optative’’ or ,,potential,’’ that we have tried to distinguish at all.</p>
