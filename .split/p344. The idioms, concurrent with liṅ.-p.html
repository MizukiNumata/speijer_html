    <p>344. The idioms, concurrent with liṅ.</p>
    <p>Apart from the many-sidedness of its employment, it is to be observed, that the <skt>liṅ} is in most cases not indispensable. The imperative, the present, the future, kṛtyas are often concurrent idioms, occasionally the conditional. The imperative in the subdivisions a), b) and c), as will be shown hereafter (348-352), the present in the subdivisions e) and f), as will plainly appear when we treat of subordinate sentences (458 b, 468, 471) (*1). On the kṛtyas see 357, on the conditional 347.</p>

    <p>{Especially the future in -syati.}</p>
    <p>But it is especially the future in <skt>-syati} that often is employed so as to express a kind of subjunctive mood. The difference which logically exists between the positive statement of some future fact on one hand and the utterance of an exhortation, a wish, a doubt, a supposition, sim. on the other, is not so strong a bar practically as to keep wholly apart the functions of the future tense and the subjunctive mood. Occasionally the same grammatical form may do duty for both. As far as Sanskrit is concerned, we may even state that in the majority of cases there is no boundary between the two. Indeed, the future in <skt>-syati} is available in almost every subdivision, belonging to the department of the <skt>liṅ}, save the hypothetical mood.</p>
    <p>Examples of the future = subjunctive mood.</p>
    <p>a.) <i>exhortation</span> and <i>precept</span>. R. 1, 61, 2 <skt>diśam anyāṃ prapatsyāmas tatra tapsyāmahe tapaḥ}, from the context it is evident that these words mean: <i>let</span> us go to another region, <i>let</span> us do penance there. Kathâs 43, 86 <skt>tadgaccha pārśvaṃ tasyādya prabhāte drutameṣyasi} (— you shall return quickly at daybreak).</p>
    <p>b.) <i>wish</span>. R. 2, 96, 21 <skt>api nau vaśamāgacchetkovidāradhvajo raṇe / api drakṣyāmi bharatam} (o that I might see the banner —, that I might see Bharata).</p>
    <p>c.) <i>possibility</span> and <i>doubt</span>. Panc. 282 <skt>dhūrtaścintayāmāsa / kimahamanayā… kariṣyāmi / kiṃca kadāpy asyāḥ pṛṣṭhataḥ ko’pi sameṣyati tanme mahānanarthaḥ syāt} (the rogue reflected: What shall I do with her? And perhaps somebody will come after her; then I shall get into great inconvenience). — Especially the future of the auxiliary, <skt>bhaviṣyati}, often expresses <i>probability</span>, Mhbh. 1, 76, 32 <skt>vyaktaṃ} (I am sure, father, Kaca will have been injured or has died), Panc. 176 the deer Citrânga tells how himself has escaped the hunters, but <skt>mama yūthaṃ tair lubdhakair vyāpāditaṃ bhaviṣyati} (my flock is sure to have been killed by them).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. If such phrases, as »I blame,’’ »I do not believe,’’ »I cannot endure,’’ »I wonder if (<skt>yadi}),’’ »I suppose, surmise,’’ »it is time’’ are added to the potential statement, <skt>liṅ} is idiomatic (see P. 3, 3, 147-150; 152-153; 168), the future being but rarely allowed, cp. P. 3, 3, 146 and 151 with comm. But if the said verbs are only implied, the future in <skt>-syati} is used side by side with the optative. (*2)</p>
    <p>f.) <i>purpose</span>. Pat. I, p. 7 the master of the house comes to the potter and asks him <skt>kuru ghaṭaṃ kāryamanena kariṣyāmīti} (make me a pot, that I may make use of it). Likewise R. 2, 54, 28 Bharadvâja says to Râma <skt>daśakrośa itastāta girir yasminnivatsyasi} (at a distance of ten <i>kroça</span> from here there is a mountain where you may dwell, cp. Lat. <i>mons in quo habites</span>). Cp. also <skt>na} with fut. = »lest’’ 405 R. l.</p>

    <p>The interchangeableness of present and optative in such relative sentences will be made clear by this. In Panc. I we have a series of ten çlokas (54-63) expounding what kind of people are fittest for attending on a king. All of these çlokas are framed on the same scheme, three pâdas being made up of a relative sentence, whereas the fourth makes up the apodosis, being the refrain <skt>sa bhavedrājavallabhaḥ}. Now, in five çlokas out of the ten, the verb of the protasis is an <i>optative</span>, but in three it is a <i>present</span>, in one it is wanting. In the tenth the optative is employed <i>together with</span> the present (I, 55) <skt>prabhuprasādajaṃ vittaṃ supātre yo niyojayet / vastrādyaṃ ca dadhāty aṅge bhavedrājavallabhaḥ}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>The sûtra P. 3, 3, 146 is accepted too narrowly by the commentators. It enjoins the future in <skt>-syati} for expressing the notion »to be sure, certainly,’’ and s. 147 is to be considered an exception to it.</p>
