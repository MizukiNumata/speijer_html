    <p>Inversely a sanskrit optative may occasionally be rendered by a future. Mhbh. 1, 160, 1 Kuntî asks the brahman, at whose house she dwells, why he and his family are lamenting <skt>[duḥkhaṃ] viditvāpy apakarṣeyaṃ śakyaṃ cedapakarṣitum} (I will remove your pain, if possible, fr. <i>je chasserai votre douleur</span>). So Panc. 282, which example is quoted above, optative and future alternate; likewise Panc. 65 <skt>evaṃ kṛte tava tāvat prāṇayātrā kleśaṃ vināpi bhaviṣyaty asmākaṃ ca punaḥ sarvocchedanaṃ na syāt}.</p>
