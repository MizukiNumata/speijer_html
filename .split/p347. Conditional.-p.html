    <p>347. Conditional.</p>
    <p>The so called conditional (<skt>lṛṅ}) is properly the past of the future in <skt>-syati}. In classic Sanskrit its employment is limited to the expression of the so called <i>modus irrealis</span>, that is the mood significative of what would happen or have happened, if something else should have occurred, which really has not taken place. Then, mostly, both protasis and apodosis contain the conditional. (*1)</p>
    <p>Ch. Up. 6, 1, 7 <skt>yaddhyetadavedipyan kathaṃ me nāvakṣyan} (for if they had known it, why should they not have told me so?), Panc. 237 <skt>tad yadi tasya vacanam akariṣyann ete tato na svalpo ’py anartho ’bhaviṣyad eteṣām} (for if they had done according to his words, then not the least misfortune would have befallen them), Daç. 111 <skt>tau ced rājaputrau nirupadravāvevāvardhiṣyetāmiyatā kālena tavemāṃ vayovasthāmasprakṣyetām} (if those two princes should have grown up without accidents, they would have reached your age by this time), Kumâras. 6, 68 <skt>gāmadhāsyatkathaṃ nāgaḥ… ā rasātalamūlāt tvam avālambiṣyathā na cet} (how would the serpent [Çesha] bear the earth, if you [Vishnu] had not lifted it up from the bottom of hell?), Ch. Up. 1, 101 4 <skt>na vā ajīviṣyamimānakhādan} (forsooth, I should have died, if I had not eaten them). In the examples given, the conditional in the apodosis sometimes denotes a hypothetical past, sometimes a hypothetical present, but in the protasis it is always expressive of a past. I do not recollect having met with any instance of the conditional denoting the hypothetical present in both members; M. 7, 20 f. i. it is signified by the <skt>liṅ} in the protasis and by the conditional in the apodosis <skt>yadi na praṇayed rājā daṇḍaṃ daṇḍyeṣvatandritaḥ / śūle matsyānivāpakṣyandurbalān balavattarāḥ} (if the king were not prompt to inflict punishment on those, who deserve it, the stronger would roast the weaker like fish on the spit). For the rest, it is everywhere allowed to use the <skt>liṅ} instead of the conditional, f. i. R. 2, 64, 22 <skt>yadyetadaśubhaṃ karma na sma me kathayeḥ svayam / phalenmūrdhā sma te rājansadyaḥ śatasahasradhā} (if you had not told me yourself this evil deed, your head would have fallen off in a thousand pieces), <skt>kathayeḥ} and <skt>phalet} = <skt>akathayiṣyaḥ} and <skt>aphaliṣyat}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the archaic dialect the conditional had a larger sphere of employment. Though rarely used in its original meaning of a future’s past (f. i. Ṛgv. 2, 30, 2 <skt>yo vṛtrāya sinamatrābhariṣyat} »who was about to take away the provision of Vrtra’’), it occurs there occasionally as the past of the <skt>liṅ}, even in not-hypothetical sentences. Maitr. S. 1, 8, 1 <skt>sa tad eva nāvindat prajāpatir yad ahoṣyat} (Praj. did not get what he could sacrifice) (*2), Çat. Br. 14, 4, 2, 3 <skt>ktata evāsya bhayaṃ vīyāya kasmād dhyabheṣyat} (from that moment his fear vanished, for of whom could he have been afraid?) (*3).</p>

    <p>P. 3, 3, 140 <skt>bhūte ca}. — Kâç. <skt>bhūte ca kāle liṅnimitte kriyātipattau satyāṃ ḷṅpratyayo bhavati}.</p>

    <p>Even here and in similar instances the conditional shows its origin. The sentence quoted from the Maitr. S. treats of an action put into the past, if it were a present one, the sentence would assume this shape <skt>na vindati yaddhoṣyati} or <skt>juhuyāt}. In other terms, <skt>ahoṣyat} may here be considered as the past of <skt>hoṣyat}.</p>

    <p>In a well-known passage of the Chândogya-upanishad (6, 1, 3) the conditional is hidden under a false reading <skt>uta tam ādeśam aprākṣyo yenāśrutaṃ śrutaṃ bhavati} etc. Çankara explains <skt>aprākṣyaḥ} by <skt>pṛṣṭavān asi}, the Petr. Dict. accepts it as an aorist, though it is then a barbarism, for if aor., it would have been <skt>aprākṣīḥ}. Replace <skt>aprakṣyaḥ}, and all is right »had you but asked the instruction, by which etc.’’ Cp. P. 3, 3, 141.</p>
