    <p>348. Imperative.</p>
    <p>Sanskrit imperative (<skt>loṭ}) comprises more than is conveyed by its European name. It is not only the equivalent of what we are wont to understand by this mood, but it is also expressive of wishes, possibility and doubt.</p>
    <p>We will treat severally of its different employment:</p>

    <p>{I. The mood of precept and exhortation.}</p>
    <p>I. The imperative, like ours, signifies an <i>order</span> or <i>injunction</span>, <i>permission</span>, <i>precept</span>, <i>exhortation</span>, <i>admonition</span>.</p>
    <p>Examples: 2d person. Kathâs. 81, 56 <skt>asmat svāminīkṛtaṃ / bhajasvātithyamuttiṣṭha snāhi bhuṅkṣva tataḥ param} (enjoy the hospitality of our mistress, get up, take a bath, thereafter take food), Çâk.
