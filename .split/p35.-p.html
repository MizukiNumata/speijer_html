    <p>The manifold relations between nouns and verbs or nouns and nouns are signified by cases, by the periphrase of cases, by compounding. As to the proportional frequency of the said modes of expression, <i>nude cases</span> are more freely employed in poetry than in prose, oftener in the earlier periods of Sanskrit than in the latter; whereas <i>periphrastic expression</span> strives at extending by the time, the implements of circumlocution increasing in number and variety, the nearer we approach to our own times. But the faculty of signifying case-relations by confining the correlating nouns into the somewhat rudimentary shape of <i>compounds</span> has not been overturned nor diminished by time. On the contrary, whether we look at their frequency or at their manifoldness or at their expansibility, the old dialect is by far surpassed by the alexandrinian period of Sanskrit literature.</p>
