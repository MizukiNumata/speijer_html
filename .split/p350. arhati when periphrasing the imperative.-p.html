    <p>350. arhati when periphrasing the imperative.</p>
    <p>Another manner of expressing polite request, equally frequent, is using the verb <skt>arhati}. One says <skt>śrotum arhasi} = <skt>śrūyatām}, cp. our ,,deign to listen.’’ Nala. 3, 7 Nala says to the gods <skt>māṃ na preṣayitum arhatha} (please, send not me), Çâk.

The <skt>liṅ} and the future in <skt>-syati} are concurrent idioms with the imperative, the former especially in exhortations and precepts (343, <i>a</span>), the latter, when giving instructions (344, a). The future does, however, not cease to be a future; in other terms, it is not used in orders or permissions to be acted up to immediately, but if two or more injunctions are given, then often the one prior in time is put in the imperative, the latter expressed by the future. Mâlav. III, p. 79 <skt>bhadre yāsyasi / mama tāvad utpannāvasaram arthitvaṃ} (you may go, but first hear —). Hit. 108 the old jackal instructs the others, how to get rid of the blue jackal, their insolent kinsman. When giving the general precept, he uses the imperative <skt>kuruta}, but the future <skt>kariṣyatha}, when giving the special injunction, to be acted up at a fixed point of time in the future (*1).</p>

    <p>In this very meaning a few passages of the Mahâbhârata afford a 2d pers. plur. of the medial future in <skt>-dhvam}, instead of <skt>-dhve}, in other terms a formal difference, which stamps these forms as <i>imperatives of the future</span>. Bopp, <i>Vergl. Gr.</span> § 729 quotes three instances: Mhbh. 1, 17, 13; 3, 228, 8; 6, 27, 10, see Holtzmann, <i>Grammatisches aus dem Mhbhta</span> p. 33. To them I can add a fourth, Mhbh. 1, 133, 13: Drona being seized by a shark, calls upon his disciples for rescue <skt>grāhaṃ hatvā tu mokṣyadhvaṃ mām}.</p>
