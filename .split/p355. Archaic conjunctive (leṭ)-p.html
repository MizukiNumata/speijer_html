    <p>355. Archaic conjunctive (leṭ)</p>
    <p>In classic Sanskrit the 1st person of the imperative is less used than the other two (cp. 356).</p>

    <p>{the 1st persons of the imperative belong to the leṭ}</p>
    <p>In fact, these 1st persons belong to another set of forms, viz. the so-called <b>conjunctive</span> (<skt>leṭ}). In both dialects of vaidik compositions, in mantras as well as in brâhmaṇa-works, this conjunctive is still to be met with. But Pâṇini already qualifies it as archaic. In epic and classic Sanskrit, indeed, its 2d and 3d persons exist no more, whereas its 1st persons are the very forms considered to make part of the imperative (<skt>loṭ}).</p>
    <p>This vaidik conjunctive shows a great relationship both in form and employment to Greek conjunctive, especially that of the Homeric dialect. It may express both, the hortative mood and the optative, and is much used in subordinate sentences, conveying a doubt or a purpose or having general bearing. Here are some instances of its use. Ait. Br. 2, 2, 5 <skt>yadi ca tiṣṭhāsi yadi ca śayāsai draviṇamevāsmāsu dhattāt} (whether you are standing or lying down, give us wealth), Rgv. 10, 85, 36 the marriage-mantra <skt>gṛbhṇāmi te saubhagatvāya hastaṃ mayā panyā jaradiṣṭhiryathāsaḥ}, ibid. 39 <skt>dīrghāyurasyā yaḥ patirjīvāti śaradaḥ śatam} (may her husband have a long life, may he reach a hundred autumns), TS. 6, 5, 6, 2 <skt>yo’tā jāyātā asmākaṃ sa eko’sat} (who shall be born of her, must be one of us). (*1).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Like <skt>na} with optative in the epic dialect (451 R. 1), so <skt>net} with conjunctive in the vaidik works may be = »lest.’’ Nir. 1, 11 <skt>nej jihmā yantyo narakaṃ patāma} (lest by going astray we shall go to hell), Ait. Br. 2, 12, 2 <skt>nen ma ime’nabhiprītā devān gacchān} (lest they should go to the devas unsatisfied).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Some few conjunctives, occurring in the archaic texts, belong to the system of the aorist, as <skt>karāma} in Rgv. 10, 15, 6 <skt>mā hiṃsiṣṭa pitaraḥ kena cinno yadva āgaḥ puruṣatā karāma} (do us no injury, fathers, on account of any offence, which we, after the manner of men, may have committed against you).</p>

    <p>Instances from Rgv., AV., Çat. Br., Ait. Br. are brought together by Delbrück in his treatise <i>Der Gebrauch des Conjunctivs und Optativs im Sanskrit und Griechischen</span> Halle 1871, especially p. 107-190. — It may be observed, that the Chândogya-upanishad has not a single instance of the <skt>leṭ} in the 2d or 3d person.</p>
