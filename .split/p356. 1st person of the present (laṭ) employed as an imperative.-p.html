    <p>356. 1st person of the present (laṭ) employed as an imperative.</p>
    <p>Instead of the 1st persons of the imperative, classic Sanskrit often uses the present (<skt>laṭ}), sometimes when having the nature of a hortative, as <skt>gacchāmaḥ} when = ,,let us go,’’ but especially in dubitative interrogations: <skt>kiṃ karomi kva gacchāmi} (what shall I do, where shall I go?)</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) present with hortative meaning. R. 2, 96, 20 <skt>athavehaiva tiṣṭhāvaḥ saṃnaddhāvudyatāyudhau} (let us stand still here —), Panc. 86 <skt>tasyāt ma śarīradānaṃ kurmaḥ} (let us present him with our body), Prabodh. II p. 29 <skt>bhavatu / asminn āsane samupaviśāmi} [= <skt>-viśāni}], R. 3, 61, 18 <skt>vanaṃ sarve vicinuvaḥ} (let us search through the whole forest). (*1) — The idiom is regular with <skt>tāvat}. Çâk. I <skt>bhavatu / pādapāntarita eva viśvastāṃ tāvadenāṃ paśyāmi} (well, I will look on her —), Mudr. IV, p. 138 Malayaketu to Bhâgurâyaṇa <skt>tannopasarpāvaḥ śṛṇuvas tāvat} (therefore, let us not approach, let us rather listen), Panc. 261 <skt>atraiva durge sthitastāvad vedya ko’yaṃ bhaviṣyati}. Cp. <skt>yāvat} with present 478 al. 2.</p>
    <p>b) present in dubitative interrogations: Panc. 40 <skt>kiṃ… śastreṇa mārayāmi kiṃ vā viṣaṃ prayacchāmi kiṃ vā paśudharmeṇa vyāpādayāmi} (shall I kill him with a weapon, or give him poison or put him to death as one kills a beast?), Hit. 95 <skt>kva yāmaḥ kiṃ vā kurmaḥ}, Mhbh. 1, 155, 42 <skt>kiṃ karomy aham āryāṇāṃ niḥśaṅkaṃ vadatānaghāḥ} (friends, tell me frankly, what shall I do for you = <skt>kiṃ karavāṇi-}). An instance of this idiom in the passive voice may be Panc. 37 <skt>tatkiṃ kriyate} [sc. <skt>āvābhyām}] »what shall be done by us?’’</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>If these instances occurred only in verbs of the 1st conjugation,</p>
    <p>where the formal difference between the endings of the present and those of the imperative is a slight one, one could account for them in a satisfactory way by supposing errors of the copyists. But, in reality, instances being likewise found among the verbs of the 2d conjugation, it must be recognized, as we do, that the present instead of the imperative is idiomatic for the 1st person. Such phrases as <skt>kurmaḥ}, <skt>śṛṇuvaḥ} = <skt>kṛṇavāma} and <skt>śṛṇavāva} should have moved Cappeller in his edition of the <i>Ratnâvalî</span> in Boethlingk’s <i>Chrestomathy</span> to leave intact the presents of the kind, be has changed into imperatives.</p>
