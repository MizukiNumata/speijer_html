    <p>357. Kṛtyas.</p>
    <p>The <<b>>kṛtyas</span>, as far as they do duty for finite verbs, may rank with the tenses, which are expressive of the subjunctive mood. They have the nature of Latin gerundivum, and, like this, they belong to the passive voice. But their sphere of employment is wider. They signify not only that, which one is <i>obliged</span> to do or what is <i>prescribed</span> to be done, but also what must happen by <i>necessity</span> or that which is <i>fit</span>, <i>expected</span>, <i>likely</span> to happen. {P. 3, 3, 163; 171; 172.}</p>

    <p>{The many sidedness of their employment.}</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. <i>duty, precept</span>. Yâjñ. I, 117 <skt>vṛddha-bhāri-nṛpa-snātastrī-rogi-vara-cakriṇām panthā deyaḥ} (one must make room for an old man, one charged with a burden, for a king, a <i>snâtaka</span>, a woman, a sick man, a bridegroom and one in a carriage), Nala. 1, 19 <skt>hantavyo ’smi na te rājan} (do not kill me), Çâk, I <skt>āśramamṛgo ’yaṃ na hantavyaḥ} (— may not be killed), Panc. 269 <skt>śṛgāla āha / adyāpyekavāraṃ tavāntike tamāneṣyāmi paraṃ tvayā sajjokṛtakrameṇa sthātavyam}. When substituting for these kṛtyas the active voice, one would get in the first example <skt>panthānaṃ dadyāt}, in the second <skt>mā vadhīḥ}, in the third <skt>na kaścid dhantum arhati}, in the fourth <skt>tiṣṭha}.</p>
    <p>2. <i>necessity</span>. Panc. 167 <skt>mayāvaśyaṃ deśāntaraṃ gantavyam} (I must needs go abroad), ibid. I, 450 <skt>mūrkhaṇāṃ paṇḍitā dveṣyā nirdhanānāṃ mahādhanāḥ} (blockheads are the natural enemies of the learned, the poor of the wealthy).</p>
    <p>3. <i>probability</span>, <i>conjecture</span>, <i>expectation</span>, etc. Çâk. III <skt>asmin latāmaṇḍape saṃnihitayā tayā bhavitavyam} (she is sure to be in the neighbourhood of the bower), Panc. 240 <skt>siṃhaś cintayām āsa / guhāyāṃ rātrau kenāpi sattvenāgantavyam} (the lion reflected: surely some animal will come into this hole to-night), Prabodh. V, p. 106 <skt>kvacid upakṛtiḥ kāryāmībhiḥ kṛtā kriyate ‘thavā} (are they likely to confer any benefit or have they done so before or are they doing so now?). The last example plainly shows, that the kṛtya borders upon the sphere of a participle of the future, <skt>kārya} being here almost = <skt>kariṣyamāṇa}. Thus <skt>bhavitavya} or <skt>bhāvya} may be even = »future,’’ <skt>bhavitavyatā} »the future.’’</p>
    <p>4. Even <i>desert</span> and <i>ability</span> find their expression by them, Kâç. on P. 3, 3, 169 gives this example <skt>bhavatā khalu kanyā voḍhavyā} = <skt>bhavān khalu kanyāṃ vahet} = <skt>bhavān etad arhed iti}, and on sûtra 172 <skt>bhavatā khalu bhāro voḍhavyaḥ} = <skt>bhavān hi śaktaḥ}. — The kṛtyas may be also expressive of <i>indignation</span> at some fact, not expected. Mudr. VII, p. 220 Râxasa, when hearing the glory of his foe Çâṇakya proclaimed in the very streets of Pâtaliputra, exclaims <skt>etad api nāma rākṣasena śrotavyam} (and even this Râxasa must hear!); Daç. 78 the wretched Jaina monk deplores his misfortune and the necessity, he has been put to, to break with the faith of his fathers <skt>mama tu mandabhāgyasya… aphalaṃ viprambhaprāyam īdṛśam idam adharmavartma dharmavatsamācaraṇīyam āsīt} (thus, on such a road of disbelief, as this, which gives no fruit, but rather deception, I must walk, as if it were the true faith).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Some kṛtyas are restricted to »necessity,’’ viz. those in <skt>-āvya}, cp. P. 3, 1, 125. — Other irregularities of meaning are caused by the improper employment of the passive voice, as <skt>dānīya}, when denoting »the person who deserves a gift,’’ <skt>saṃdheya} »one fit to make an alliance with’’ (Panc. III, 8), <skt>udvejanīya} »to be dreaded’’ (ibid. III, 142). {P. 3, 3, 113.} Some may have even an active meaning, see P. 3, 4, 68.</p>
