    <p>When laying down the syntax of the participles, there must be distinguished between the participial forms and the participial employment.</p>

    <p>{Participles.}</p>
    <p><i>As to their form</span> the <<b>>participles</span> are adjective nouns, derived by constant suffixes from any verbal root, and which are the proper exponents of participial employment.</p>

    <p>{Different classes of them.}</p>
    <p>Sanskrit possesses 1. three participles for the continuous action, one in each voice (<skt>kurvan}, <skt>kurvāṇaḥ}, <skt>kriyamāṇaḥ}), which are named <i>participles of the present</span> (*1), 2. two <i>participles for the future</span>, one in the active voice (<skt>kariṣyan}) and one serving both for the medial and the passive (<skt>kariṣyamāṇaḥ}), 3. the <i>kṛtyas</span>, which are passive participles for the future, but with a special employment, see 357, 4. two <i>participles for the past</span>, to signify what is done, achieved, completed as <skt>kṛtaḥ} and <skt>kṛtavān}, the latter of which has always an active meaning, as to the former see 360.</p>
    <p>It must be kept in mind, that the participles, unless they themselves do duty as finite verbs, denote the past, present or future only with regard to the time, involved by the chief verb of the sentence.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>In Sanskrit, this term is less improper, than in many other languages, because its present has chiefly the character of expressing the durative (<skt>vartamāna}), see 326.</p>
