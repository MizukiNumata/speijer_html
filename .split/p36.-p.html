    <p>The same <i>richness</span> and <i>abundance</span> is generally displayed in the several constructions, taken separately. Two or more conceptions of the same case-relation being equally possible in thought, they mostly are also available in speech; there is perhaps no language, where one may be less limited in this respect. Thus we meet side by side with a partitive genitive, a partitive ablative, a partitive locative. Causality may be denoted by means of the instrumental as well as by the ablative or by various periphrase, as <skt>hetoḥ}, <skt>kāraṇena}, <skt>kāraṇāt} etc. The person spoken to may be put in the accusative or dative or expressed by means of <skt>prati}, <skt>puraḥ}, <skt>agre}. The verbs of giving are not only construed with the dative of the person bestowed upon, but also with genitive or locative. The dative of the purpose is interchangeable with many a periphrase (<skt>artham}, <skt>nimittam} etc.) and with infinitives. And so on. — Add to this the many implements for periphrase, <i>either</span> prepositions, partly ancient and common to the Indo-european mother-tongue, partly new-formed in Sanskrit, <i>or</span> nouncases and verbal forms that have almost the force of prepositions, as <skt>sakāśam}, <skt>samīpam} etc. when = „to,” <skt>kṛte} „on account of,” <skt>varjayitvā} or <skt>muktvā}<i> </span>= „without,” <skt>mārgeṇa} = „by means of”, sim. Moreover, in most cases one is free to compound the substantive with those words, for ex. to say <skt>jīvitahetoḥ} instead of <skt>jīvitasya hetoḥ} (for the sake of life), <skt>pāṣāṇopari} = <skt>pāṣāṇasyopari} (over a stone), etc. — Finally it must be kept in mind that in a large amount of cases one has even the choice of either expressing the case-relation, or letting it be implied by a compound, made up of the two correlating substantives <skt>puruṣasiṃhaḥ} = <skt>puruṣeṣu siṃhaḥ} (a lion <i>among</span> men), <skt>rājapuruṣaḥ} = <skt>rājaḥ puruṣaḥ} (the king’s attendant), <skt>ahihataḥ} = <skt>ahiṇā hataḥ} (slain <i>by</span> a serpent), sim.</p>
