    <p>362. Participial employment.</p>
    <p>II. We will now treat of the <<b>>participial employment</span>. Before defining it, abstraction is to be made of the case in which the participles are nothing more or less than simple attributive adjectives, as <skt>viruddo dharmaḥ}, when = „a forbidden law’’ or even substantives, as <skt>vṛddaḥ} when = „old man,’’ <skt>śiṣyaḥ} when „disciple.’’ (*1). Apart from this adjectival function, the participles serve to express attending circumstances or other qualifications of the main action, whether temporal or local, causal, concessive, conditional, hypothetical, etc. In other terms, in Sanskrit, as elsewhere, the participles are a concurrent idiom of subordinate sentences, of which, indeed, they may be said to exhibit the rudimentary form.</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. the participle equivalent to a simple relative clause. Panc. 2 <skt>atra ca maddattāṃ vṛttiṃ bhuñjānānāṃ paṇḍitānāṃ pañcaśatī tiṣṭhati} (here are five hundred scholars, who enjoy a salary which I give them).</p>
    <p>2. the participle denoting time, state, condition, circumstance. Panc. 268 <skt>śṛgālaḥ kopāviṣṭas tam uvāca} (the jackal being filled with anger, said to him), Bhoj. 17 <skt>evaṃ vittādivyayaṃ kurvāṇaṃ rājānaṃ prati kadācin mukhyāmātyenettham abhyadhāyi} (now, as the king made such expenses of money etc., his first minister once addressed him thus), Mrcch. VI, p. 222 <skt>varaṃ vyāyacchato mṛtyur na gṛhītasya bandhane} (better to die while showing prowess, than in fetters after having been seized).</p>
    <p>3. the participle denoting cause, motive. Panc. 58 <skt>te tathā kartavyā yathā palāyanto hanyamānāḥ svargaṃ na gacchanti} (they must be brought to such a pass as to be excluded from heaven, being killed in the flight), here the complex <skt>palāyanto hanyamānāḥ} points at the cause of their not reaching heaven; R. 1, 1, 99 <skt>paṭhan rāmāyaṇaṃ naraḥ pretya svarge mahīyate} (by reading the Râmâyana one gains heaven).</p>
    <p>4. the participle equivalent to a concessive sentence. Panc. 304 <skt>bhi niṣiddhas tvaṃ mayānekaśo na śṛṇoṣi} (though I have dissuaded you several times, you do not listen to me). In this meaning, <skt>api} is generally subjoined to the participle, see 423.</p>
    <p>5. the participle expressive of the protasis of a conditional or hypothetical sentence. Daç. 140 <skt>asya tu pāṇigrāhakasya gatimananuprapadyamānā bhavatkulaṃ kalaṅkayeyam} (if I should not follow the path of my [deceased] husband, I should dishonour your family), Kathâs. 77, 92 <skt>ajalpato jānataste śiro yāsyati kaṇḍaśaḥ} (if you do not say it, and know it, your head will fall off into a thousand pieces).</p>
    <p>6. the participle denoting a purpose, aim, intention. Thus is the proper employment of the participle of the future. Kathâs. 38, 157 <skt>tyakṣyantī taṃ deśaṃ brāhmaṇasādakṛta vasatiṃ svām} (being about to leave her country, she ceded her house to the brahmans), Daç. 79 <skt>prakṛtisthānam ūnvidhāsyan karṇīsutaprahite pathi matimakaravam} (as I wished to bring them back to their natural state —), Mhbh. 1, 163, 16 <skt>vṛkṣam ādāya rākṣasaḥ / tāḍayiṣaṃs tadā bhīmaṃ punar abhyadravad balī} (the giant took a tree and ran once more at Bhîma, that he might strike him).</p>

    <p>A special rule of Pâṇini (3, 3, 114) teaches the neuters of participles in <skt>-ta} to be admissible as nouns of action. So Mhbh. 1, 157, 41 <skt>sarvaiḥ saha mṛtaṃ śreyo na ca me jīvitaṃ kṣamam} (it is better to die together, nor can I bear to live). Pat. I, p. 11 <skt>hikkita-hasita-kaṇḍūyitāni na eva doṣāya bhavanti na api abhyudayāya} (hiccoughing, laughing and scratching are neither sinful nor pious actions).</p>
