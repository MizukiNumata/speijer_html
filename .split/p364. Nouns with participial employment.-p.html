    <p>364. Nouns with participial employment.</p>
    <p>The participial employment is not limited to the participles. Any adjective may be employed as if it were a participle. It is then usual to add to it the participle <skt>sant} (being). Yet, <skt>sant} is not indispensable and is often wanting, especially if it is a bahuvrîhi that has a participial employment.</p>
    <p>Examples: <i>a.</span>) of <skt>sant} added. Çâk. IV <skt>vanaukaso ‘pi santo laukikajñā vayam} (though living in the forests, we know the world), ibid. III <skt>kutas te kusumāyudhasya satastaikṣṇyam etat} (how did you come by that sharpness, you, whose arrows are but flowers?), Kathâs. 24, 67 <skt>bāḍhaṃ mayā sā nagarī dṛṣṭā vidyārthinā satā / bhramatā bhuvam} (I saw that town, indeed, while I wandered about when a student), Panc. 44 <skt>kathaṃ dṛḍhabandhanabaddhā satī tatra gacchāmi} (how can I go there, being tied with strong fetters?).</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) of the mere adjective. Panc. I, 109 <skt>kiṃ bhaktenāsamarthena kiṃ śaktenāpakāriṇā} (what is the use of a faithful [servant], if he be not able, what, of an able, if he be not faithful?), Çâk. II two young ascetics are approaching, the king, before their being ushered in, knows them by their voice and says <skt>aye dhīrapraśānta-svarais tapasvibhir bhavitavyam} (by the sound of their voice, which is strong and soft at the same time, they must be inferred to be ascetics), Hit. 91 <skt>tām ākhyātukām eva satvaramāgato ‘ham} (wishing to tell it [sc. the news <skt>vārtām}], I have come here).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Bahuvrîhis, the predicate of which is a participle, generally share the participial employment. Panc. 130 <skt>atha taṃ dṛṣṭvā śaṅkitamanā vyacintayat} (when be saw him, be became anxious and reflected), Ven. I, p. 25 <skt>devi samuddhatāmarṣair asmābhir āgatāpi bhavatī nopalakṣitā} (Madam, by the angry mood I am in, I have not noticed your coming here), Mudr. III, p. 112 <skt>āryeṇaivaṃ sarvato niruddhaceṣṭāprasarasya mama bandhanam iva rājyaṃ na rājyam iva} (if mylord in this manner crosses my liberty of movement, my kingdom seems a prison to me, not a kingdom).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. <skt>sant}, however, is occasionally added even to real participles. Panc. 126 <skt>tena mūrkheṇa vānareṇa kruddhena satā… prahāro vihitaḥ} (now, that stupid monkey, being in an angry temper, gave a blow), ibid. 335 <skt>so ‘pi karkaṭas tatraiva sthitaḥ sansarpaprāṇān apāharat} (while standing on that very spot, the crab etc.), Mhbh. 1, 166, 2 <skt>sa… pūrvam evāgatāṃ / satīṃ dadarśāpsarasaṃ tatra}, here <skt>satī} added helps the understanding of the remote past. Cp. Panc. 248, l. 7.</p>
