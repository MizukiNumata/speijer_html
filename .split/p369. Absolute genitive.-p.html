    <p>369. Absolute genitive.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the <<b>>absolute genitive</span> is a concurrent idiom of the absolute locative. It is far from bearing the general character of the latter. It is limited, indeed, to the expression of some action, not cared for while performing the main action. Sometimes the absolute genitive may be rendered by ,,though, notwithstanding, in spite of’’ and the like, sometimes it is simply pointing out, which action is going on at the time when the main action intervenes, then we may translate it by ,,while’’ or ,,as.’’ Other restrictions of its employment are: 1. its predicate must have a durative meaning, and is therefore in most cases a participle of the present, or at least a partic. or adjective, which does duty as such; 2. its subject must be a person. Upon the whole, the absolute genitive is usually found in standing phrases (*1).</p>
    <p>According to P. 2, 3, 38 the absolute genitive is expressive of some action not cared for, while performing the action of the chief sentence. The commentary illustrates this rule by the example <skt>rudataḥ prāvrājīt} which is interchangeable with <skt>rudati prā-}, because it means <skt>rudantaṃ putrādikamanādṛtyu pravrajitaḥ} (he has forsaken the world not caring for the tears of his family). (*2).</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. the gen. = <i>though</span>, <i>in spite of</span>, <i>notwithstanding</span>. Panc. 193 <skt>yadete mayā pṛṣṭāḥ sacivāstāvadatra sthitasyāpi tava tatparīkṣārtham} (that I have asked them, though you were here, was but to make a trial), Mudr. III, p. 124 <skt>nandāḥ… paśava iva hatāḥ paśyato rākṣasasya} (— under the very eyes of Râxasa), Panc. 152 <skt>mūṣkaḥ] pazyato me paribhraman}, Mhbh. 1, 102, 70 <skt>vicitravīryas taruṇo yakṣmaṇā samagṛhyata / suhṛdāṃ yatamānānāmāptaiḥ saha cikitsakaiḥ / jagāma… yamasādanam} (Vicitravîrya became consumptive, when being young, and died in spite of the efforts of his friends and skilled physicians), R. 2, 100, 4 <skt>na hi tvaṃ jīvatas tasya vanamāgantum arhasi} (do not go to the forest during his lifetime [= <i>eo vivo</span>]). In the last example the notion of disregard appears, if one eliminates the negation: »the action of going to the forest though he is living, must not be done by you.’’ (*3).</p>
    <p>2. the gen. is expressive of a situation, existing at the time, when the main action intervenes, Eng. <i>while</span>, <i>as</span>. Panc. 131 <skt>evaṃ vadatas tasya sa lubdhakas tatrāgatya… nibhṛtaḥ sthitaḥ} (while he was speaking thus, the said hunter came and concealed himself), ibid. 44 the barber’s wife asks her friend <skt>nāyaṃ pāpātmā mama gatāyā utthitaḥ} (the rogue [she means her husband] has not risen [from his couch] during my absence, has he?), Kathâs. 18, 356 <skt>iti cintayatastasya tatra toyārthamāyayuḥ… striyaḥ} (while he reflected thus, females came), ibid. 3, 11 <skt>teṣāṃ nivasatāṃ tatra… tīvro durmikṣaḥ samajāyata}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Between these two different kinds of absolute genitive there are, of course, interjacent links. The <i>anâdara</span> of the action conveyed by the absolute genitive may be more than simple independence and less than full disregard. Mbbh. 1, 153, 7 <skt>aham enaṃ hanaṣyāmi prekṣantyāste sumadhyame} »I shall kill him, beautiful lady, and even in your presence,’’ here the absolute turn denotes the easiness of the enterprise. (*4)</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. The absolute genitive seems to be very rare in the archaic dialect. (*5)</p>

    <p>These rules have chiefly been fixed by F. de Saussure in his valuable and exhaustive treatise <i>de l'emploi du genitif absolu en Sanscrit</span>.</p>
    <p>The rule of the subject being a person is violated Kumâras. 1, 27 <skt>anantapuṣpasya madhorhi cūte dvirephamālā saviśeṣas aṅgā} (though spring has an immense variety of flowers, the rows of bees cling especially to the âmra-flower), unless it be supposed that Kâlidâsa means the personified Spring. — In this passage of the Râmayaṇa (3, 11, 58) <skt>tato bhktavatāṃ teṣāṃ viprāṇāmilvalo ‘bravīt / vātāpe niṣkramasveti} a participle of the past in <skt>-tavant} is the predicate.</p>

    <p>Pâṇini’s sûtra runs thus: <skt>ṣaṣṭhī cānādare}. The preceding s. 37 <skt>yasya ca bhāvena bhāvalakṣaṇam} enjoins the employment of the absolute locative. Now, s. 38 allows the genitive too, but only for the case, that there is to be expressed <skt>anādara}. One may ask, what is the exact meaning of this term. Does it mean »disregard,’’ or has it rather a more general import, that of »indifference?’’ The former interpretation needs implies the participial action being known to the agent of the main notion, but this is no requisite to the latter. If we consider the practice of Sanskrit phraseology, it becomes very probable, we must take <skt>anādara} in its widest sense. Then all cases of absolute genitive may range under it. In such phrases as R. 1, 60, 15 <skt>saśarīro nareśvaraḥ / divaṃ jagāma kākutstha munonāṃ paśyatāṃ tadā} (under the eyes of the mums, the king [Triçanku] ascended to heaven) the <i>anâdara</span> is to be found in this, that the chief action is going on quite independently of the circumstance, that the holy men were its spectators. Then, the term <i>anâdara</span> holds also good for the case, that the absolute genitive is merely expressive of the situation,</p>
    <p>The Mahâbhâshya has no comment on our rule, the Kâtantra does not mention it at all, see Trilocanadâsa on Kât. 2, 4, 34 (p. 499 of Eggeling’s ed.).</p>

    <p>See de Saussure, p. 23. In the same book, p. 63-74 plenty of instance, prove the frequency of the phrase <skt>paśyatas tasya} and the like.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*4)</p>
    <p>de Saussure, p. 24 and 25 quotes a few passages pointing to the fact, that the absolute gen. occasionally may answer to fr. <i>pour peu que</span> = <i>for aught</span>.</p>

    <p>The oldest instance of it, known to de Saussure, is Maitrâyaṇîyopanishad 1, 4 <skt>miṣato bandhuvargasya mahatīṃ śriyaṃ tyaktvāsmāllokādamuṃ lokaṃ prayātāḥ}. Another instance from the archaic dialect is Âp. Dharm. l, 2, 7, 13 <skt>paśyato ‘sya}, cp. the foot-note on p. 288 above.</p>
