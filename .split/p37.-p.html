    <p>In consequence, the three general classes, we have set up, — cases, periphrase, compounds — do but represent one and the same logical category and are in practice coordinate. For clearness’ sake however, as they cannot be dealt with promiscuously, they require to be treated successively. Accordingly chapt. III-VII will contain the syntax of the cases, chapt. VIII the periphrastic expression of case-relations; in chapt. IX the different kinds of compounds — including also dvandva and karmadhâraya, though logically belonging to other categories — will be gone through.</p>
