    <p>Apart from this absolute genitive, Sanskrit upon the whole shows a preference for employing genitives of the participle, either as dative-like genitives (129) or when depending on some substantive. The frequency of this turn makes it sometimes difficult to distinguish between the absolute and the not-absolute construction.</p>

    <p>{The semi-absolute genitive.}</p>
    <p>In some phrases both seem to mingle. For them we may use the term of semi-absolute construction, for the logical relation between the genitive and the principal sentence, though not wholly wanting, is very loose, indeed. (*1) Here are some instances. Panc. 154 <skt>evaṃ cintayato mahākaṣṭena sa divaso vyatikrāntaḥ} (»he thinking so’’ or »for him as he thought so’’ the day passed slowly), Daç. 144 <skt>iha ca no vasantīnāṃ dvādaśa samāḥ samatyayuḥ}, and so regularly to denote »while somebody was doing so and so, some other arrived, the son rose or set, time passed etc.’’ See f. i. Panc. 56, l. 1, R. 5, 11, 68, Kathâs. 15, 123, R. 2, 62, 19, ibid. 85, 14. This idiom borders on that, treated 128 R. 2.</p>
    <p>Of a somewhat different nature are such instances as Mudr. V,. p. 180 <skt>candraguptasya viketuradhikaṃ lābhamicchataḥ / kalpitā mūlyam eteṣāṃ krūreṇa bhavatā vayam} (as Candragupta in selling them [the jewels], desired an exorbitant profit, you, cruel man, have made ourselves the price), Panc. 162 <skt>tad enaṃ muktvā mama jīvantyā nānyaḥ pāṇiṃ grahīṣyati}, Çâk. I <skt>karaṃ vyādhunvantyāḥ pibasi ratisarvasvam adharam}, Nâgân. I, p. 8 <skt>tan nivāsayogyam idaṃ tapovanaṃ manye bhaviṣyatīha vasatām asmākaṃ nirvṛtiḥ}. In the first of these examples the genitive may be accepted as a dative-like one (129), in the remaining it depends on a noun (<skt>pāṇim}, <skt>mama} understood, <skt>nirvṛtiḥ}). Likewise Nala. 24, 15, Panc. 57 <skt>yadi mama sthānārtham udgatasya mṛtyur bhaviṣyati}, etc. etc. Cp. also the foot-note on p. 94 of this book.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The differences between the absolute and the semi-absolute genitives are sometimes very small, indeed. Panc. 156 <skt>evaṃ me cintayatas te bhṛtyā mama śatrūṇāṃ sevakā jātāḥ}, here the absolute turn would be doubtful but for the pronoun of the 1st person repeated. That in such phrases, as »while A. was doing this, B. arrived,’’ the genitive is thought by Sanskrit-speakers an absolute one, is proved by this, that the absolute locative is used too. Mhbh. 1, 169 1 <skt>vasatsu teṣu pracchannaṃ pāṇḍaveṣu mahātmasu / ājagāmātha tāndraṣṭuṃ vyāṣaḥ}, Kathâs. 42, 165 <skt>athaitasyāṃ ca mayi ca… maraṇādhyavasāyinyorāgatas tvam ihādhunā}.</p>
