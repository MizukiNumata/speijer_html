    <p>372. Semi-absolute instrumental.</p>
    <p>The semi-absolute employment must also be stated for the instrumental. Here are some instances. Kathâs. 29, 55 <skt>sakhi bhuktaiḥ phalair etair jarā na te bhaviṣyati} (<i>by eating</span> these fruits you will enjoy eternal youth), R. 2, 64, 18 <skt>sa coddhṛtena bāṇena sahasā svargam āsthitaḥ} (<i>as soon as</span> the arrow <i>had been drawn</span> out, he mounted to heaven), Panc. 57 <skt>subhage samastaiḥ śatrubhir hatair annaṃ pānaṃ cāsvādayiṣyāmi} (my dear, I will not take either food or drink until after having killed all the enemies), ibid. 178 <skt>bhadra na bhetavyam asmadvidhair mitrair vidyamānaiḥ} (do not fear, <i>with</span> such friends as we are), Kathâs. 55, 213 <skt>dṛṣṭayā vindhyavāsinyā patnīputrau tvam āpsyasi}, Panc. 194 <skt>tair jjātaiḥ parapakṣaś ca vaśyo bhavati} (Lat. <i>his cognitis et tui et adversarii tibi obnoxii erunt</span>). In all of them the absolute locative might have been used. The instrumental represents the action, expressed by the participle, as the cause or motive or means of the main action, and in this respect it shows a close affinity to the Latin absolute ablative.</p>
