    <p>377. Periphrastic tenses and moods.</p>
    <p>We may divide this periphrastic conjugation into the following classes:</p>
    <p>I. To the past participle the present <skt>asti} or <skt>bhavati} is added, f. i. Prabodh. V, p. 103 <skt>hā putrakāḥ gatāḥ stha datta me prativacanam}, Mâlat. IV, p. 65 <skt>abhyupapannavān asmi}. This idiom falls together with the employment of the sole past participle as a past tense, see 338.</p>
    <p>II. The past participle is attended by another tense or mood of <skt>asti} or <skt>bhavati}.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples: Daç. 100 <skt>itthaṃ ca mayopamantribho ‘bhūt} (and I addressed him with these words), Kathâs. 79, 132 <skt>rājāpy uccalito babhūva} = <skt>rājāpy uccacāla}, Mhbh. 1, 42, 34 <skt>śrutaṃ hi tena tadabhūt} (for he had heard this). — Çâk. V <skt>kim uddiśya bhagavatā kāśyapena matsakāśamṛṣayaḥ preritāḥ syuḥ}, here the optative of the past is expressed by periphrase, Kathâs. 27, 32 <skt>kiṃ mayāpakṛtaṃ rājño bhavet} (in what can I have offended the king?). From the archaic dialect I add Ait. Br. 1, 4, 1 <skt>yaḥ pūrvam anījānaḥ syāt} (he, who has never before performed a sacrifice). Cp. 846.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. By putting <skt>bhaviṣyati} to the past participle, the future perfect may be expressed. Mhbh. 1, 162, 21 <skt>arthau dvāvapi niṣpannau yudhiṣṭhira bhaviṣyataḥ} (both purposes will be performed), Prabodh. II, p. 45 <skt>tataḥ… śāntir uparatā bhaviṣyati} (then Çânti will have departed this life).</p>
    <p>III. The participle of the future is accompanied by the auxiliary.</p>
    <p>This idiom is almost limited to the archaic dialect. In the brâhmaṇas the participle of the future not rarely joins with <skt>bhavati} and <skt>syāt}. Ait. Br. 2, 11, 6 <skt>taṃ yatra nihaniṣyanto bhavanti tadadhvaryur barhir adhastād upāsyati} (on which spot they are to kill [the victim], there the adhvaryut brows sacred grass [<i>barhis</span>]), Çat. Br. 3, 2, 2, 23 <skt>yatra suptvā punar nāvadrāsyan bhavati} (when he, after having slept, is not to sleep again), Âcv. Gṛhy. 1, 3, 1 <skt>yatra kva ca hoṣyant syāt}.</p>
