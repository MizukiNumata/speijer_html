    <p>IV. The participle of the present with <skt>āste}(*1), <skt>tiṣṭhati}, <skt>vartate}, <skt>asti}, <skt>bhavati} is expressive of a <<b>>continuous</span> action and is to be compared with English <i>to be</span> with the partic. in <i>-ing</span>, <skt>cittayann āste} or <skt>tiṣṭhati} etc. „he is reflecting,’’ <skt>cittayann bhūt} „he has been reflecting,’’ <skt>cittayann āsīt} etc. — Panc. 42 <skt>kaulikaḥ… svākāraṃ nigūhamāṇaḥ sadaivāste} (the weaver was always concealing his disposition), Kathâs. 42, 140 <skt>eṣo ‘nayā krīḍann āsta} (he was sporting with her); Daç. 156 <skt>nṛpātmajā tu… rudanty eva sthāsyati} (but the princess will not cease weeping), Panc. 330 <skt>sā yatnena rakṣyamāṇā tiṣṭhati} (she is being guarded carefully); Mhbh. 1, 11, 5 <skt>tasyāhaṃ tapaso vīryaṃ jānann āsam} (I was knowing the power of his ascese), Utt.

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. The participle in <skt>-ta} or a verbal adjective, provided that they have the meaning of a present, may be similarly construed with <skt>āste}, <skt>tiṣṭhati} and the rest. Panc. 285 <skt>sarvo ‘pi janaḥ svakarmaṇaiva ratas tiṣṭhati} (everybody is content with his trade), ibid. 283 <skt>mahān matsyaḥ salilān niṣkramya bahiḥ sthita āste} (— is staying outside the water), ibid. 160 <skt>tasya rakṣakasya bṛhatkanyā tatra śayane suptāsīt} (— was sleeping on that couch), ibid. 318 <skt>paripūrṇā ‘yaṃ ghaṭaḥ saktubhir vartate} (this pot is filled with porridge), R. 2, 75, 29 <skt>mā ca taṃ… drākṣīd rājyastham āsīnam} (and may he never see him occupy the royal dignity), Vikram. IV, p. 131 <skt>nīpaskandhaniṣaṇṇas tiṣṭhati} (— is sitting —).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. In the same way verbs meaning <i>not ceasing to do</span> are construed with the participle.

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. The archaic dialect expresses the continuous action also by the participle with the verb <skt>i}, occasionally <skt>car} (Cp. Whitney § 1075, <i>a</span> and <i>b</span>). Ait. Br. 1, 25, 2 <skt>tāṃ [sc. iṣuṃ] vyasṛjaṃstayā puro bhindanta āyan} (it was this, they shot off, and by which they destroyed the towns), Pancaviṃçabrâhmaṇa <skt>adaṇḍyaṃ daṇḍena ghnantaś caranti} (*2).</p>
