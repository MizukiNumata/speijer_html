    <p>The gerunds hold a place somewhat intermediate between infinitive and participle. As to their etymology, they are petrified noun-cases, and for this reason they are not declinable.</p>

    <p>{Gerund in -tvâ (-ya). Its original meaning.}</p>
    <p>I. <<b>>The gerund in <skt>-tvā} (<skt>-ya})</span> is the petrified instrumental of a verbal noun. At the outset <skt>kṛtvā} was, as it were, a kind of infinitive of the aorist. This original nature is discernible <i>a.</span>) when the gerund is construed with <skt>kim} and <skt>alam}, <i>b.</span>) if the action conveyed by it has a general subject.</p>
    <p>a.) With <skt>kim} and <skt>alam} the gerund serves to express a prohibition, cp. 353 R. 1. Daç. 137 <skt>kiṃ tava gopāyitvā} (»do not conceal,’’ liter. »what [profit should be] to you by concealing?’’). R. 2, 28, 25 <skt>alaṃ te vanaṃ gatvā} (have done going to the forest). (*1).</p>
    <p>b.) Panc. III, 107 <skt>vṛkṣāṃś chittvā paśūn hatvā kṛtvā rudhirakardamam / yady evaṃ gamyate svarge narakaṃ kena gamyate} (if by cutting down trees, by killing victims, by shedding streams of blood, if thus one goes to heaven, by what way does one go to hell?).</p>

    <p>Something of the kind, indeed, is contained in a rule of Pâṇini (3, 4, 18) <skt>alaṃkhalvoḥ pratiṣedhayoḥ prācāṃ ktvā} »according to the eastern grammarians the gerund is to be put with <skt>alam} and <skt>khalu}, if they express a prohibition.’’</p>
    <p>The following sûtra (3, 4, 19) <skt>udīcāṃ māṅo vyatīhāre} has been wholly misunderstood by the commentators even up to Patanjali. Not the verbal root <skt>mā}, but the particle of negation is meant I am convinced, our sûtra does not contain a new rule, but it is the continuation and at the same time the explanation of the preceding, in other terms, it is an old vârttika. The eastern grammarians, it is said, teach the use of <skt>alam} and <skt>khalu} in prohibitions »<i>in exchange</span> for [= <i>instead of</span>] (<skt>vyatīhāre}) <skt>mā}, prescribed by the Northern ones.’’ In fact, <skt>alaṃ kṛtvā} = <skt>mā kārṣīḥ}. — Of <skt>khalu} thus used I know no instances from literature.</p>
