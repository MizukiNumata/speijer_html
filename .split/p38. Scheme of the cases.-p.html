    <p>38. Scheme of the cases.</p>
    <p>The nominative or first case (<skt>prathamā} sc. <skt>vibhaktiḥ}) is expressive of the sentence’s subject and predicate, see 1 and 5. Moreover the nominative is employed to denote the noun taken by itself, apart from the sentence, as will be shown hereafter.</p>
    <p>The person addressed is put in the vocative (*1).</p>
    <p>Of the six others the general purport (*2) may be sketched thus:</p>
    <p>1. The accusative or second case (<skt>dvitīyā}) denotes a.) the <i>whither</span>, b.) the object of transitives, c.) an extension in time or space, d.) it is used adverbially.</p>
    <p>2. The instrumental or third case (<skt>tṛtīyā}) may be called the <i>with</span>-case, for it signifies <i>with what</span>, <i>by what</span>, <i>how</span>. According to the various applications of this fundamental notion, there may be set up divers kinds of instrumental. So we have an instrumental of accompaniment — the so-called <i>sociative</span> — one of the instrument, one of the agent, of the way, the means, the manner, the quality, of time, of value, and so on.</p>
    <p>3. The dative or fourth (<skt>caturthī}) points out the <i>direction</span> of a movement. Mostly it is employed in a metaphorical sense. For the rest, its employment admits of a division into two kinds: a.) the so-called <i>dative of interest</span>, b.) the <i>dative of the purpose</span>.</p>
    <p>4. The ablative or fifth (<skt>pañcamī}) denotes <i>whence</span> there is a starting, withdrawal, separation, distance, consequence and the like, it being applied to various categories of thought.</p>
    <p>5. The genitive or sixth (<skt>ṣaṣṭhī}) upon the whole may be described as the case, which signifies <i>cohesion</span>. It chiefly serves to express relations existing between substantives (*3) and according to the logical varieties of these relations we may distinguish between the <i>possessive genitive</span>, the <i>partitive</span>, the <i>subjective</span>, the <i>objective</span> etc. Besides, the sixth case is wanted with some adjectives (as those of likeness, knowing and the contrary) and some verbs (as those of remembering). Sanskrit also has three more kinds of genitive, each of them displaying a particular character, nl. 1. the <i>genitive of the time, after which</span>, 2 the <i>absolute genitive</span>, 3. the <i>genitive, which is concurrent with the dative of interest</span>.</p>
    <p>6. The locative or seventh (<skt>saptamī}) signifies the <i>where</span> and therefore it generally is to be rendered by such prepositions as in, at, to, on. As its employment is not restricted to real space, but of course also extends to other spheres of thought, there are various classes of locatives, for ex. those of <i>time</span>, of <i>circumstance</span>, of <i>motive</span> (the so-called <i>nimittasaptamī</span>), the <i>absolute locative</span>. On the other hand the locative is not limited to the spot, where something is or happens, but it also signifies the <i>aim reached</span>.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. All nouns are declinable and put in the said cases, if wanted. This applies also to such conventional terms and signs, as the grammatical roots, affixes, anubandhâs, prâtipadikâs, etc.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Indeclinable are 1ly the adverbs, 2ly some nominal derivations of the verb, namely the gerunds and the infinitives. Why they are devoid of declension is quite plain; for they do duty of noun-cases and generally their etymology does agree with their employment.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Though the vernacular grammarians have a proper term for the vocative — <i>āmantrita</span> P. 2, 3, 48 — and even two for the vocative of the sing. (the voc. sing. especially is named <i>sambuddhi</span>, ibid. 49) it is however not considered a distinct eighth case, but an appendix to the nominative.</p>
    <p>Pāṇini, after the having stated (2, 3, 46) <skt>prātipadikārthaliṅgaparimāṇavacanamātre prathamā} » the first case serves only to signify the gender and number of the thing designated by the word’s rude form or prātipadika”, this proceeds : <skt>sambodhane ca (47) sā’’mantritam} (48), that is »it serves also to address, then is bears the name of <i>āmantrita</span>.”</p>
    <p>— By the way I remark, that in translating P.’s rule on the proper sphere of the first case, I have dissented from the traditional interpretation. According to the commentaries <skt>parimāṇa} means »size” or »measure” — such words as <skt>droṇa}, <skt>khāro}; <skt>āḍhaka} are given for examples — and <skt>vacana} is »the grammatical number” so as to make the whole signify: »the first case denotes the mere meaning of the <i>prātipadika</span>, the mere gender, the mere size (or weight), the mere number.” See f. ex. the kāśika on our sūtra.</p>
    <p>That interpretation cannot be right. In the first place, in the Pāṇinian terminology, it must be observed, <i>prathamā</span> does not mean the word put in the nominative case, but only the suffix of that case, just as <i>dvitīyā</span> names the suffix of the accus., <i>tritīyā</span> that of the instrumental and so on. Now, to say in earnest, the <i>prathamā</span> has the duty of denoting <i>three</span> things apart from the purport of the prātipadika, viz. linga or gender, parimāṇa or measure and vacana or number is unacceptable and almost ridiculous, for the suffix of the nominative cannot give us certain knowledge but as to two of them, nl. gender and number; the size or measure of the thing denoted by the <i>prātipadika</span> is made as little known by declension, as its color or its age. Moreover gender and number are grammatical conceptions, measure, size, weight geometrical ones. It is time to discharge Pāṇini of the absurdity imputed to him by his interpreters and to show he is here as plain and judicious as that great grammarian is wont to be.</p>
    <p>The commentators were misled by <i>vacana</span>, which they did accept as expressing »the grammatical number”, as, indeed, it very often does. Yet here it must be the <i>bhāva</span> of <i>vac</span> in its original meaning <i>the naming</span> or <i>the being named</span>, cp. P. 1, 4, 89 <skt>āṅ maryādāvacane} (=<i>āṅ</span>, when <i>naming</span> a boundary), 2, 1, 33 <skt>kṛtyairadhikārthavacane} (=with kṛtyās, when <i>denoting</span> exaggeration), 5, 3, 23 <skt>prakāravacane thāl}, etc. Therefore it is not <skt>vacana}<i>,</span> which here is carrying the meaning of <i>grammatical number</span>, but <skt>parimāṇa}; for this word may as well be employed in the narrower sense of »size; periphery,” as in the larger of »any measure whatever,” and accordingly it is also occasionally a synonym of <skt>saṃkhyā}, (cp. P. 5, 2, 41 and the passages adduced in the Petrop. Dict. IV, p. 540).</p>
    <p>For these reasons the sûtra, which occupies us, is to be analysed in this way <skt>prātipadikārtha ye liṅgaparimāṇe (= <skt>ye liṅgasaṃkhye} or <skt>ye liṅgavacana}, for <skt>saṃkhyā} and <skt>vacana} are both expressive of the grammatical number) tayairvacanamātre prathamā}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>Pâṇini has short and will-chosen terms to point out their different provinces. The category of the accusative he names <i>karma</span>, that of the instrumental <i>kartṛ</span> »agent&quot; and <i>karaṇa</span> » instrument,” that of the dative <i>sampradâna</span>, that of the ablative <i>apâdâna</span>, that of the locative <i>adhikaraṇa</span>. The duties of the genitive have not found an adequate expression.</p>
    <p>With respect to the nominative it must be observed, that Pāṇini’s definition (see the preceding note) does ascribe a larger sphere of employment to that case than we do in styling it the case of »the subject and predicate.” In this the Indian grammarian is right. Nouns quoted or proffered outside the context of sentences are always put in the <i>nominative</span>.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>In this book the term <i>substantive</span> has not the limited acceptation it has with the etymologist and the lexicographer, but includes any noun that syntactically has the worth of a substantive, as <i>satya</span>, when = »truth.”</p>
