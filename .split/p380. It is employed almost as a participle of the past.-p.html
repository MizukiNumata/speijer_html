    <p>380. It is employed almost as a participle of the past.</p>
    <p>But in its most common employment the gerund may be said to do duty as a past participle of the active. Like the absolute locative and the other participial employment it enables the speaker to cut short subordinate sentences and to avoid the accumulation of finite verbs (14, I). Indeed, it has the full function of a participle. As a rule, it denotes the prior of two actions, performed by the same subject. {P. 3, 4, 21.} Accordingly its subject is that of the chief action. So it usually refers to a nominative, if the chief verb is active, or to an instrumental, if it is a passive. Nothing, however, prevents its being referred to other cases, since the main subject may occasionally be a gen., locat., dative etc.</p>
    <p>1. Instances of the gerund referring to a nominative or to an instrumental are so common as to be found on almost every page. Panc. 3 <skt>athāsau rājā tāṃ pratijñāṃ śrutvā… tasmai sādaraṃ tān kumārān samarpya parāṃ nirvṛtim ājagāma} (then the king having heard this promise, entrusted the princes to him and was highly satisfied with this), here <skt>śrutvā} and <skt>samarpya} refer to <skt>rājā}; — Panc. 70 <skt>atha tena taṃ śatruṃ matvātmānaṃ tasyopari prakṣipya prāṇāḥ parityaktāḥ}, the gerunds <skt>matvā} and <skt>prakṣipya} refer to <skt>tena}.</p>
    <p>2. Instances of the gerund referring to other noun-cases: 1. to an accus. R. 3, 41, 18 <skt>ātmānaṃ ca hataṃ viddhi hṛtvā sītām} (be aware that yourself will be lost, when seizing Sîtâ); — 2. to a genitive. Nala. 3, 14 <skt>tasya dṛṣṭvaiva vavṛdhe kāmastāṃ cāruhāsinīm} (his love increased as soon as he had beheld the fair one), Panc. 69 <skt>na yujyate svāminastasya sāmarthyamaviditvā gantum} (it does not befit mylord to go before having explored his strength); — 3. to a dative. Kumâras. 2, 18 <skt>svāgataṃ svān adhīkārān prabhāvair avalamvya vaḥ / … yugabāhubhyaḥ} (welcome to you, mighty ones, who uphold your offices by your power); — 4. to a locative. Panc. 125 <skt>vānare vyajanaṃ nītvā vāyuṃ vidadhati}, the loc. is the absolute one: »as the monkey having brought the fan, was fanning’’. — The subject of the gerund is comparatively often a genitive or a locative, owing to the frequent employment of the dative-like genitive (129) and of the absolute locative. For the rest, it is only from the context, that the subject of a given gerund is to be known. That f. i. Bhoj. 96 <skt>ekadā rājā dhārāmagare vicaran kvacit pūrṇakumbhaṃ dhṛtvā samāyāntīṃ pūrṇacandrānanāṃ kāṃcid dṛṣṭvā… prāha}, the gerund <skt>dhṛtvā} refers to <skt>kāñcit}, but <skt>dṛṣṭvā} to <skt>rājā}, can be learned no otherwise.</p>
    <p>3. The gerund may even refer to a subject not expressed, but understood. Utt. IV, p. 72 <skt>svayam upetya vaideho draṣṭvyaḥ}, from the context it is plain, that <skt>tvayā} is implied. Likewise Nâgân. V, p. 91 <skt>hā kumāra kvemaṃ prāṇebhyo ‘pi vallabhaṃ janaṃ parityajya gamyate [sc. tvayā]}. Or to a general subject, as f. i. R. 3, 48, 23. Cp. 379 <i>b</span>).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Like the participles, the gerund may serve to express different logical relations, as is evident from these examples. Daç. 149 <skt>nāham idaṃ tattvato nāvabudhya mokṣyāmi bhūmiśayyām} (I shall not rise <i>before</span> having learned what this really is), R. 3, 21, 10 <skt>tān bhūmau patitān dṛṣṭvā… mahāṃstrāso ‘bhavan mama} (<i>when</span> I saw… great fear arose within me), Panc. III, 77 <skt>ulūkaṃ nṛpatiṃ kṛtvā kā naḥ siddhir bhaviṣyati} (what profit shall we have, <i>if</span> we make the owl our king?). Cp. 362.</p>
