    <p>381. Gerund expressive of simultaneousness.</p>
    <p>Not always the gerund can be said to denote a past action, done previously to the chief action. Sometimes there is simultaneousness. R 3, 43, 9 <skt>evaṃ bruvāṇaṃ kākutsthaṃ prativārya śucismitā / uvāca sītā}, here <skt>prativārya} and <skt>bruvāṇam} are simultaneous, »Laxmana thus speaking and dissuading her.’’ Cp. Daç. 159 <skt>kena vā nimittenotsavam anādṛtyaikānte bhavān utkaṇiṭhata iva… tiṣṭhati} (by what cause do you keep a part, not caring for the feast, as if longing for somebody?), ibid. 182 <skt>ahaṃ yuṣmadājñayā pitṛpanam abhirakṣya tadupajīvī prativasāmi} (by your orders I guard the cemetery and in virtue of this function it is there that I dwell). — Cp. also the idiom, taught 203.</p>
    <p>Hence the gerund, in the same way as the participle of the present (378), may even attend such verbs as <skt>āste}, <skt>tiṣṭhati}, <skt>vartate}, to signify a continuous action. Kumâras. 1, 1 <skt>pūrvāparau toyanidhī vagāhya sthitaḥ pṛthivyā iva mānadaṇḍaḥ} (extending to both oceans, the eastern and the western, [Mount Himâlaya] stands as the measuring stick of the earth). Daç. 177 <skt>sarvapaurānatītya vartate} (he is the foremost of all the townsmen)(*1), M. 7, 195 <skt>uparudhyārimāsīta} (he [the king] must keep the enemy invested).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Occasionally the gerund is even expressive of a predicative attribute. R. 3, 19, 4 <skt>kālapāśaṃ samāsajya kaṇṭhe mohān na budhyate} (be is unaware, be has fastened the rope of Death round his neck), Mâlav. V, p. 124 <skt>sakhe / madapekṣām anuvṛtyānayā dhāriṇyā pūrvacaritaiḥ sambhāvyata evaitat} (my friend, you only think so from Dh. having acted up to my desire by her former actions!). R. 2, 73, 4 <skt>aṅgāram upaguhya sma pitā menāvabuddhavān}.</p>
