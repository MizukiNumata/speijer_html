    <p>382. gerund in -am.</p>
    <p>II. The other gerund, that in <skt>-am}, is as to its origin the acc. of a verbal noun. It denotes some concomitant action and is comparatively seldom employed. When put twice, it is expressive of repeated or uninterrupted action. Daç. 30 <skt>lāṭeśvaro deśasyāsya pālayitus tanayāṃ taruṇīratnam asamānalāvaṇyaṃ śrāvaṃ śrāvam avadhūtaduhitṛprārthanasya tasya nagarīmarautsīt} (the king of Lâta always hearing of the matchless beauty of the daughter of the monarch —), ibid. 95 <skt>āsvādam āsvādam} (savouring without interruption) (*1).</p>
    <p>For the rest the gerund in <skt>-am} is limited to standing phrases, at least in classic Sanskrit. Pâṇini (3, 4, 25-64) gives a list of them. Of the kind are P. 3, 4, 29 <skt>kanyādarśaṃ varayati} (as soon as he sees a girl, he woos her), ibid. 52 <skt>śayyotthāyaṃ dhāvati} (after rising from his couch be runs), ibid. 50 <skt>leśagrāhaṃ yudhyante} (v. a. they fight seizing each other by the hair), Daç. 144 <skt>jīvagrāham agrahīṣam} (I captured him alive), cp. P. 3, 4, 36, Mudr. II, p. 76 <skt>loṣṭaghātaṃ hataḥ} (was killed by lumps of earth) cp. P. 3, 4, 37, Mhbh. 1, 154, 30 <skt>niṣpiṣyainaṃ balād bhūmau paśumāram amārayat} (be pressed him violently to the earth and killed him as one slaughters a victim); Kumâras. 4, 26 <skt>stanasaṃbādhamuro jaghāna} (she beat her breast, injuring her bosom), cp. P. 3, 4, 55. Likewise <skt>joṣamāste} = <skt>tūṣṇīṃ bhavati}, see f. i. Viddhaç. II, p. 36. From the archaic dialect I add Ait. Br. 1, 21, 11 <skt>aṅgasamākhyāyam evāsmiṃs tadindriyāṇi dadhāti} (he deposits in him the mental and motive powers, while calling each member by its name), cp. P. 3, 4, 58. In all these expressions the gerund is the final member of a compound. — Another idiom is the employment of it with <skt>pūrvam}, <skt>prathamam} or <skt>agre}, then both the gerund in <skt>-am} and that in <skt>-tvā} are available, as <skt>prathamaṃ abhojam} (or <skt>bhuktvā}) <skt>vrajati} (he eats first, then he goes). {P. 3, 4, 24.}</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Upon the whole the gerund in <skt>-am} is oftener used in the archaic dialect of the brâhmaṇas, than afterwards, and it is even in such cases as are not specialized by Pâṇini. Ait. Br. 2, 19, 7 <skt>yad avagrāham anubrūyāt} (if he pronounces them piecemeal), Çat. Br. 12, 8, 3, 7 <skt>abhisaṃsāraṃ didṛkṣitāraḥ} (people will go and see in crowds). — Pâṇ. 3, 4, 12 speaks of the gerund in <skt>-am}, with the verb <skt>śak} as a vaidik idiom. Maitr. S. 1, 6, 4 <skt>agniṃ vai devā vibhājaṃ nāśaknuvan} = <skt>vibhaktuṃ nāśaknuvan}. Cp. TBr. 1, 1, 5, 6.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>The same purpose is served by putting twice the gerund in <skt>-tvā}. Pat. <i>passim</span> <skt>utplutyotplutya maṇḍūkā gacchanti} (frogs move by jumping). See P. 3, 4, 22 and cp. Panc. II, 100.</p>
