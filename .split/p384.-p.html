    <p>Sanskrit infinitive, like ours, acts in some degree as a complement to the main predicate. Pâṇini enjoins its being put to words of <i>being able</span>, <i>venturing</span>, <i>knowing</span>, <i>being irksome</span>, <i>being fit</span>, <i>undertaking</span>, <i>taking</span>, <i>going</span>, <i>tolerating</span>, <i>deserving</span>, <i>being met with</span>, {P. 3, 4, 65.} those of <i>sufficing</span>, <i>being a match for</span>, {P. 3, 4, 66.} and in such phrases as: there is <i>an opportunity</span>, <i>a time</span> for doing something. {P. 3, 3, 167} Of course, these injunctions do not exhaust the sphere of the infinitive’s employment, and may easily be enlarged. With the verbs of <i>wishing</span> the infinitive is likewise mentioned by Pâṇini, but as he adds in express terms, provided that the subjects of both the infinitive and the verb of wishing are the same. {P. 3, 3, 158.}</p>
    <p>Examples: Mhbh. 1, 150, 23 <skt>gantuṃ na śaknumaḥ} (we cannot go), Panc. 70 <skt>kas te pratāpaṃ soḍhuṃ samarthaḥ} (who is able to sustain your splendour?), Kumâras. 4, 11 <skt>vasatiṃ priya kāmināṃ priyāstvadṛte prāpayituṃ ka īśvaraḥ} (who, except you, my beloved [Kâma], has the power of conducting the loving maidens to their lovers?); — Ven.

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Among the words of <i>sufficing</span>, the particle <skt>alam} is to be noticed. It is used with infin. sometimes in its proper sense of »being enough,’’ as M. 2, 214 <skt>avidvāṃsam alaṃ loke vidvāṃsam api vā punaḥ / pramadā hy utpathaṃ netum}, sometimes also <skt>alam} with infin. expresses prohibition, just as <skt>alam} with gerund (353, R. 1). R. 3, 59, 14 <skt>alaṃ viklavatāṃ gantum} (do not despair), Mrcch. III, p. 106 <skt>alaṃ suptajanaṃ prabodhayitum}. In the same way <skt>kim} with infin. Mudr.

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Instances of an infinitive with a verb of <i>remembering</span> may occur now and then. In this case the infin. is expressive of a past action, previously done by the same subject. (*1).</p>

    <p>Of this idiom prof. Kern has pointed out to me some passages, borrowed from an inedited Buddhistic work, written in good Sanskrit, the <i>Jâtaka-mâlâ</span> (see Hodgson, <i>Essays</span> p. 17). Somebody, who has practised the virtue of <i>ahiṃsâ</span>, says of himself <skt>smarāmi yata ātmānaṃ yataḥ prāpto ‘smi vijñatām / nābhijānāmi saṃcintya prāṇinaṃ hiṃsituṃ kvacit}. Another, famous for his munificence declares <skt>na hi smarāmy arthitayāgatānām āśāviparyāsahataprabhāṇi / himānilamlāpitapaṅkajānāṃ samānadainyāni mukhāni kartum} (v. a. I do not remember to <i>have disappointed</span> the expectation of those, who came to me as supplicants).</p>
