    <p>386. Its character.</p>
    <p>The infinitive has preserved its original nature of being a noun-case. The only difference, that exists between it and the datives and locatives (*1) of nouns of action in <skt>-ana}, <skt>-a}, <skt>-ti} etc., is that the latter are construed with the genitive of their object, but the infinitive with the accusative. For the rest, they are synonymous. It is the same, whether one says <skt>arthaṃ labdhuṃ} or <skt>arthasya lābhāya pārayati}, <skt>jayāya} or <skt>jetuṃ yatate}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>When depending on substantives, the noun of action may also be a genitive (110), f. i. <skt>kālaḥ prasthānasya} or <skt>prasthānāya} or <skt>prasthāne} or <skt>prasthātum}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>The kṛtya doing duty as noun of action is an idiom not rarely found in the prâkṛts. Especially in the type, represented by this　passage of Çâk. I <skt>kā tumaṃ visajjidavvassa ruṃdhidavvassa vā} (v.a. who are you, that you should dismiss me or stop me?).</p>
