    <p>387. Infinitive joining passive verbs, and to be rendered by the passive inf. of English.</p>
    <p>Like the nouns of action, the infinitive by itself neither belongs to the active voice nor to the passive. It may be construed with both classes of verbal forms, and seems to have an active meaning, when it is the complement of an active verb, but a passive, when of a passive. Panc. 258 we read <skt>kathaṃ śakyate tatra gantum} sc. <skt>kenacit}, which is just as good as <skt>kathaṃ kaścic chaknoti tatra gantum}; in the former sentence the subject is denoted by an instrumental, in the latter by a nominative, but in both it is the self-same infinitive, that completes the finite verb. Likewise it is equally correct to say <skt>mayā kaṭaḥ kartuṃ śakyate} as <skt>ahaṃ śaknomi kaṭaṃ kartum}.</p>
    <p>Instances of the infinitive attending in this manner a passive, are exceedingly frequent with <skt>śakyate}, <skt>śakyaḥ}, <skt>śakyam} (388), occasionally also with other verbs. Hit. 6 <skt>mayā nītiṃ grāhayituṃ śakyante} (by me they can be taught politics), R. 2, 86, 11 <skt>na devāsuraiḥ śakyaḥ prasahituṃ yudhi} (he cannot be withstood by all the devas and asuras together); — Prabodh. VI, p. 119 <skt>kaiḥ kair nāham… īhitā… dāsīkartum} (how many have not endeavoured to bring me into bondage?), Viddhaç. I, p. 15 <skt>dhārayituṃ na pāritā kiṃ punar anunetum} (I could not hold her, much less appease her). Cp. also Kumâras. 7, 57. This idiom is even used in such sentences, as Hit. 50 <skt>atrāṭavīrājye ‘bhiṣektuṃ bhavān nirūpitaḥ} (it is you who have been chosen <i>to be anointed</span> king in this forest), and Mudr. III, p. 106: Candragupta has sent for his minister Câṇakya. When arrived, the minister asks the king, for what reason he has been sent for; after hearing the reason, he replies <skt>vṛṣala / upālabdhuṃ tarhi vyamāhūnāḥ} (then I have been ordered here <i>to be upbraided</span>).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. With those participles in <skt>-ta}, which have sometimes an active and sometimes a passive meaning, the infinitive is accordingly used in both senses. Cp. (passive) Panc. 275 <skt>tvayā striyo ‘rtha etat kāryam anuṣṭhātum ārabdham} with (intransitive) Panc. 276 <skt>atha tau jalaṃ pītvā vanaphalāni bhakṣayitvā gantum ārabdhau}. Of <skt>śak}, however, there exists a partic. <skt>śakitaṃ}, which is exclusively to be used with an infinitive in the passive voice, whereas <skt>śakta} is always active (*1). Likewise <skt>yatita}, not <skt>yatna}, is put to the infinitive, when bearing a passive meaning. Mhbh. 1, 154, 9 <skt>apanetuṃ ca yatito na caiva śakito mayā}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Kâç. on P. 7, 2, 17 teaches the form <skt>śakita} for the passive, but he adds, that <skt>śakta} may also be used even then: <skt>saunāgāḥ karmaṇi niṣṭhāyāṃ śakeriṭam icchanti vikalpena / śakito ghaṭaḥ kartum / śakto ghaṭaḥ kartum} but when impersonal passive, one always says <skt>śakta}, ibid. <skt>bhāve na bhavaty eva / śaktam anena}.</p>
