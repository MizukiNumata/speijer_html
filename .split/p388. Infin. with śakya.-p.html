    <p>388. Infin. with śakya.</p>
    <p>The kṛtya <skt>śakya} may be construed in two manners. It is equally correct to say <skt>sa śakyaḥ} —, <skt>sā śakyā draṣṭum} as <skt>śakyaṃ sa} (or <skt>sā}) <skt>draṣṭum} „one can see him or her.’’ In the latter case <skt>śakyam} is a neuter and remains unchanged. There is even room for a third idiom, which is effected by construing <skt>śakyam} with the instrum. of its subject and the accusat. of its object, as <skt>śakyaṃ mayā taṃ} (or <skt>tāṃ}) <skt>draṣṭum}.</p>
