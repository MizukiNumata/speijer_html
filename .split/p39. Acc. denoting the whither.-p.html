    <p>39. Acc. denoting the whither.</p>
    <p>I. The accusative expresses whither something is moving. Panc. <skt>svagṛhaṃ prasthitaḥ} (he set out for his home), Nala 1, 22 <skt>vidarbhān agamaṃs tadā} (then they went to the country of Vidarbha), M. 2, 114 <skt>vidyā brāhmaṇam ety āha} (Knowledge came to the Brahman and said — ). In the instances adduced the movement is real. But in a metaphorical sense the accusative is likewise available. R. 2, 82, 9 <skt>jagāma manasā rāmam}, Daç. 40 <skt>tac cintayā dainyam agaccham} (by this solicitude I grew sad).</p>
    <p>This obvious construction is not the only one. The <i>aim striven</span> at may also be put in the dative (79), the <i>aim reached</span> is mostly denoted by the locative (134). Moreover various periphrase, by means of <skt>prati}, <skt>antikam}, <skt>sakāśam}, <skt>samīpam}, <skt>uddiśya} etc are concurrent idioms, see chapt. VIII.</p>
