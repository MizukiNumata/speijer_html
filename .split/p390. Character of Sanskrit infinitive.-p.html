    <p>390. Character of Sanskrit infinitive.</p>
    <p>The original nature of the infinitive has not been obscured in Sanskrit. It has everywhere the character rather of an adverb, than of a noun (*1). Not only on account of its etymology, but also of its standing in some degree outside the common system of declension and conjugation, it may be called the counterpart of the Lat. supine (*2). It has no voices, no tenses. It nowhere serves to express the subject, predicate or object of a sentence (*3). In such sentences as ,,to give is better than to receive,’’ Sanskrit avails itself of different idioms, chiefly by using nouns of action, but avoids using the infinitive (*4).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Sometimes the 3d person of the present or the optative may be equivalent to our infinitive. Panc. II, 51 <skt>dadāti pratigṛhṇāti guhyamākhyāti pṛcchati / bhuṅkte bhojayate caiva ṣaḍvidhaṃ prītilakṣaṇam} (to give, to receive, to tell one’s secret, to ask it, to be guest and host, these are the six tokens of friendship). Cp. R. 3, 47, 17 <skt>dadyān na pratigṛhṇīyāt satyaṃ brūyānna cānṛtam / etad brāhmaṇa rāmasya vrataṃ dhṛtam anuttamam} (to give, not to receive, to speak the truth, not to speak falsehood, this is the sublime vow, o brahman, practised by Râma).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Sanskrit has not the turn: accusative with infinitive (*5). Verbs of perceiving, thinking, telling etc. are construed with the accusative with participle (374).</p>

    <p>In vernacular grammar the infinitive always ranks with the <i>avyaya</span>-class. Likewise the gerund.</p>

    <p>Occasionally, even the employment of Latin supine borders on that of Sanskrit infinitive. Cp. such phrases as <i>venatum eunt, spectatum veniunt</span> with Skrt. <skt>vrajati bhoktum}, <skt>āgataḥ krīḍitum}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>In such expressions as <skt>vidyate bhoktum}, <skt>labhate bhokutum} we may speak of the infinitive as the subject and object of the finite verb, but this is only so from a logical point of view; and it is, indeed, <i>not considered</span> so by Sanskrit-speakers.</p>

    <p>F. i. <skt>dānaṃ pratigrahādviśiṣyate} or <skt>yo dadāti yaś ca pratigṛhṇāti tayor dadadvarīyān} or <skt>varaṃ dānaṃ na tu pratigrahaḥ}.</p>

    <p>Jolly, <i>Geschichte des Infinitivs</span>, p. 253 sq. asserts its existence. He quotes but two examples: Kathâs. 20, 172 <skt>rājānaṃ snātuṃ dadarśa} and Sâv. 5, 10 = Mhbh. 3, 297, 102 <skt>māṃ ca jīvitum icchasi}. In the latter passage both the Calc. and the Bomb. edition of the Mhbh. read <skt>māṃ ca jīvantam i-} and in the former <skt>snātum} is an obvious misprint for <skt>snāntam}. The participle is in both cases indispensable. So Kâç. on P. 3, 3, 158 after giving <skt>icchati bhoktum} (he wishes to eat) as an example of the infinitive, contrasts with this the participial idiom <skt>devadattaṃ bhuñjānam icchati} (Mr. B. wishes Mr. A. to eat). — Likewise R. 3, 24, 13 ed. Bomb. <skt>pratikūlitum icchāmi na hi vākyam idaṃ tvayā} the text is corrupt, the correct reading being <skt>pratikūlitam}, nor is the infin. <skt>pratikūlitum} but <skt>pratikūlayitum}. A fourth instance would be Daç. 104 <skt>na ced imāṃ vāmalocanām āpnuyāṃ na mṛṣyati māṃ jīvituṃ vasantabandhuḥ} (if I do not obtain this beautiful maiden, the God of Love will not suffer me to live), yet as <skt>mṛṣyati} is as a rule construed with acc. and <i>participle</span> (see but Mhbh. 1, 145, 9, M. 8, 346, Mhbh. 1, 95, 68, ibid. 4, 16, 28), I am convinced we have here likewise an error in the text, and <skt>jīvantam} must be put instead of <skt>jīvitum}; I should not wonder, if the good reading were found in mss.</p>
