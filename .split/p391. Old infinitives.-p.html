    <p>391. Old infinitives.</p>
    <p>The infinitive in <skt>-tum} is the sole remnant of a great many similar forms, which existed in the encient language, especially in the old dialect of the Vaidik mantras. Whitney, <i>Sanskr. Gramm.</span> § 970 gives a detailed account of them. All of them are oblique cases of nouns of action. We call them infinitives, because they share the construction of the verb, from which they are derived. Most of them were obsolete as early as the period of the brâhmaṇa-works, some indeed survived, but adopted the construction of the nouns. In such passages f. i. as Ṛgv. 9, 88, 2 <skt>sa īṃ ratho na bhūriṣāḍayoji mahaḥ purūṇi sātaye vasūni} (like a much-bearing chariot he has been horsed, the mighty one, to bring us abundant boons), we are inclined to call <skt>sātaye} an infinitive, for it has its object put in the <i>accusative</span>; likewise still Ait. Br. 2, 1, 1 <skt>yajñasya kiṃcideṣiṣyāmaḥ prajñātyai}, since <skt>kiṃcit} is the object of <skt>prajñātyai}. But in such passages as Ait. Br. 2, 17, 8 <skt>svargasya lokasya samaṣṭyai} (in order to gain heaven), the object is a <i>genitive</span>, and <skt>samaṣṭyai} can no more be called infinitive. Now, the genitive with them is predominant in the brâhmaṇas and afterwards it is the sole idiom.</p>
