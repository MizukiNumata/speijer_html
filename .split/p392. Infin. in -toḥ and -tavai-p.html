    <p>392. Infin. in -toḥ and -tavai</p>
    <p>Two old infinitives, however, are still employed in the brâhmaṇas, those in <skt>-toḥ} and in <skt>-tavai}. Of the latter I have even met with an instance in a writer of so comparatively recent a date, as Patanjali (*1).</p>
    <p>1. The infinitives in <skt>-toḥ} are either genitives or ablatives. When genitives, they are hardly found unless depending on <skt>īśvara} (*2). The phrase <skt>īśvara} with genitive in <skt>-toḥ} means »able to’’ or »liable to.’’ It must be remarked that in this idiom <skt>īśvara} sometimes agrees with its subject in gender and number, sometimes the masc. <skt>īśvaraḥ} is used irrespective of the gender and number of its subject, as if it were an indeclinable word. Ait. Br. 1, 10, 2 <skt>īśvarā hainaṃ ni vā roddhorvi vā mathitoḥ} (they are able to check him or to crush him), ibid. 1, 30, 11 <skt>īśvarau ha vā etau yajamānaṃ hiṃsitoḥ}; — ibid. 3, 48, 8 <skt>īśvaro hāsya vitte devā arantoḥ} (it may be that the gods are not gratified by hie offering), Çat. Br. 5, 1, 1, 9 <skt>tasyeśvaraḥ prajā pāpīyasī bhavitoḥ}.</p>
    <p>When ablatives, they are employed after the prepp. <skt>ā} and <skt>purā}. Then, however, they are commonly construed with the genitive of their object. Ait. Br. 2, 15, 9 <skt>purā vācaḥ pravaditoranūcyaḥ} [viz. <skt>prātaranuvākaḥ}], ibid. 7, 2, 6 <skt>ā śarīrāṇāmāhartoḥ}.</p>
    <p>2. The infinitive in <skt>-tavai} is said by Pâṇini to be synonymous with the kṛtyas. {P. 3, 4, 14.} This statement is confirmed by what we know about them from the ancient texts. In the Çatapatha they are much used, less often in similar works. Çat. Br. <skt>mūlāny ucchettavai brūyāt} (he must order the roots to be out off.)</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Pat. I. p. 2 <skt>tasmād brāhmaṇena na mnecchitavai nāpabhāṣitavai}. The infin. is here equivalent to the kṛtya, according to what is prescribed by Pâṇini (3, 4, 14).</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>I know but one instance of a genitive depending on an other word. Ait. Br. 2, 20, 21 <skt>yaśo ‘rtorbubhūṣet} ([if he] should strive after obtaining glory). In another passage Ait. Br. 6, 30, 7 the interpretation of the inf. <skt>pratyetoḥ} seems somewhat doubtful to me; the words <skt>pratyetor hantāham} are likely to mean »I am, indeed, able to understand’’, as if <skt>īśvaraḥ} should be supplied.</p>
