    <p>395. Emphatic particles.</p>
    <p>Affirmative sentences do not want to be marked as such by special particles, as is necessary with negative and interrogative sentences. Yet, strong affirmation, so-called emphasis, is expressed by such words as English <i>indeed</span>, <i>surely</span>, <i>verily</span>, viz. <skt>khalu}, <skt>kila}, <skt>nūnam}, <skt>bāḍham}, <skt>niyatam}, <skt>satyam} or in full <skt>yatsatyam}. Of them, <skt>bāḍham} and the rest rather bear the character of such adverbs, as ,,certainly, undoubtedly.’’ Mudr. VII, p. 223 <skt>yatsatyaṃ lajjita ivāsmi}, Daç. 93 <skt>tvayā niyatam… aham apadeśyaḥ}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. <skt>bāḍham} is especially used in answers »yes, indeed’’. Kathâs. 24, 67 one asks <skt>kañcit tvayā sā kanakapuro dṛṣṭā}, the other answers <skt>bāḍhaṃ mayā sā nagarī dṛṣṭā}. »Yes’’ is also <skt>tathā}. Kathâs. 81, 19 the king asks his attendant to fetch him some water, the other answers <skt>tathā}; in full, he would have said <skt>tathā kriyate yathājñāpayati devaḥ}, of which sentence all but <skt>tathā} is understood. Sometimes the relative sentence <skt>yathājñāpayati} etc. is expressed, but the rest understood. — <skt>atha kim} is also = »yes’’ (*1). Mudr, II, p. 78 <skt>na khalu viditāste nivasantaś cāṇakyahatakena / atha kim} (Râxasa asks: the accursed Câṇakya does not know they dwell in Pâtalip., does he? Answ. Yes, he does).</p>
