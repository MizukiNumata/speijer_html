    <p><skt>nūnam}, <skt>nanu}, <skt>khalu}, <skt>kila}, <skt>nāma} are the most frequent emphatic particles. The last three of them are not put at the head, but <skt>nūnam} and <skt>nanu} are usually the first word of the sentence, at least in prose.

The said emphatics are of course not wholly synonymous, the slight differences which exist between them, making it occasionally necessary to use one and to avoid another. It is also to be observed, that sometimes and in some degree the emphatics may act as a kind of connectives, in as far as they, too, are a means for linking sentences together. In the example quoted from Panc. 204, <skt>nanu} may be called with some right a causal particle, likewise <skt>khalu} and <skt>kila} in the two, quoted from Çâk. I. On the other hand, the connective <skt>hi} is sometimes a mere emphatic.</p>
