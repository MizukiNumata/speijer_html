After pronouns it is sometimes = »the same, the very.’’ Nala. 2, 12 <skt>etasminn eva kāle} (at that very time), Panc. 324 <skt>ekadaiva} (at the same time). Cp. 277.</p>

In poetry <skt>eva} is sometimes omitted, R. 3, 25, 89 <skt>nādadānaṃ śarān ghorān vimuñcantaṃ śarottamān / vikarṣamāṇaṃ paśyanti rākṣasāste śarārditāḥ}, here the scholiast is right in expounding <skt>vikarṣamāṇam eva}, »the râxasas did not see him charging his arrows nor discharging them, they saw him only keeping his bow bent [so swiftly Râma was shooting].’’ So Varâh.
