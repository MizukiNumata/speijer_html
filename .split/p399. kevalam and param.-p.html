    <p>399. kevalam and param.</p>
    <p>The other restrictives are <skt>kevalam}, <skt>param}, <skt>kāmam} and <skt>tāvat}. Of these, <skt>kevalam} and <skt>param} are = „only, at least, but.’’ Panc. 312 <skt>na vetsi tvaṃ jītaṃ kevalam unnadasi}, Kathâs. 32, 143 <skt>yogabalena cet / eṣā rājñā navā bhāryā hanyate tanna yujyate / … tasmād buddhibalenaiṣā rājño viśliṣyatāṃ param}.</p>

    <p>{kâmam}</p>
    <p><skt>kāmam} mostly announces some adversative particle, being almost = »to be sure’’ (442, 1°). It is but seldom used without adversative sentence. Daç. 126 <skt>yady apsarobhiḥ saṃgacchase saṃgacchasva kāmam} (if you have intercourse with apsarases, so).</p>

    <p>{tâvat}</p>
    <p><skt>tāvat} has a peculiar employment. Properly it is, an elliptical phrase, for at the outset it, must have meant something like this: „as much [is certain].’’ Accordingly it advances a statement which is asserted „at all events’’ or „at least’’ or „before others.’’ As it is often an enclitic, the said translations are generally too forcible. In expositions of many links one likes to put <skt>tāvat} to the first of them, then it may be compared with fr. „d’abord,’’ cp. 439. It is also much used in exhortations and with imperatives.</p>
    <p>Examples: Kathâs. 28, 60 <skt>aho keyamasaṃbhāvyavapurbhavet / na tāvanmānuṣī} (o! who may this beautiful woman be? She is, <i>at all events</span>, not a mortal). Panc. 318 a brahman thus reflects <skt>paripūrṇo ‘yaṃ ghaṭastāvatsaktubhir vartate / tadyadi durbhikṣaṃ bhavati tadanena rūpakāṇāṃ śatamutpadyate} (<i>well</span>, this pot is filled with porridge, now if there should be a famine, then —), ibid. 37 Damanaka says to Karataka <skt>āvāṃ tāvadapradhānatāṃ gatau / eṣa piṅgalakaḥ… svavyāpāraparāṅmukhaḥ saṃjātaḥ / sarvo ‘pi parijano gataḥ / tatkiṃ kriyate} (<i>in the first place</span> we have lost our influence, next our king has become averse to his duty, and finally all his attendants are gone, what is to be done in these circumstances?), ibid. 23 <skt>tat tāvaj jānāmi kasyāyaṃ śabdaḥ} (<i>therefore</span>, I will know <i>at least</span>, whose voice it is), Mudr. III, p. 114 <skt>yat tallekhyapattraṃ tāvad dīyatām} (only, give up the letter). Çâk. VI the king eagerly exclaims <skt>dhanus tāvat} (my bow! = »I want to have my bow and to have it soon’’); likewise Mâlav. I, p. 20 the king greets the dancing-masters <skt>svāgataṃ bhavaddyām}, then turning to his attendance he continues <skt>āsane tāvadtrabhavatoḥ}, cp. Vikram. V, p. 180 <skt>argho ‘rghas tāvat}.</p>

    <p>{jâtu.}</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. <skt>jātu}, an old emphatic particle, seems to be restricted to poetry and almost to negative and interrogative sentences: <skt>na jātu} »not at all.’’ Sometimes it may be almost = »perchance, perhaps.’’ Kathâs. 25, 24 <skt>jānīyātsa vṛddho jātu tāṃ purīm}. Sometimes <skt>cit} is affixed to it, see 402.</p>
