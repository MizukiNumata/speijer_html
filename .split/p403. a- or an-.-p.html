    <p>The negation <skt>a-} — <skt>an} — is only used as the first member of compounds, both bahuvrîhis, and tatpurushas, see 218 and 223 <i>c</span>). In tatpurushas its force is not always the same. <skt>amitra} f. i. not only denotes ,,not a friend’’ but also the very opposite of <skt>mitra}, viz. ,,foe.’’ Of the latter kind are sundry common words, as <skt>analpa} (much), <skt>aneka} (many), <skt>ayaśaḥ} (dishonour). The former type involves identity of meaning with the separate negation <skt>na}, f. i.
