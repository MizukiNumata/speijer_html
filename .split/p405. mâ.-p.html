    <p>405. mâ.</p>
    <p><skt>mā} is the proper negation to be used with the imperative and its concurrent idioms; in other terms it expresses <i>prohibition</span>, or in a wider sense <i>the desire to keep off</span>. Examples of its employment with imperative, optative, aorist without augment have been given 353 and 354. A strong prohibition is not rarely expressed by the sole <skt>mā} or by <skt>maivam} (not so) with ellipsis of the verb; <skt>mā tāvat} signifies reprobation, as Mâlav. I, p. 3.</p>
    <p>With imperative <skt>mā} is also used, if the imperative expresses doubt or uncertainty. Mhbh. 14, 6, 8 <skt>gaccha vā mā vā} (you are free to go or not [as you like]). In the same meaning also with <skt>liṅ}, as Panc, I, 225 <skt>viṣaṃ bhavatu mā bhūyāt} (there may be poison or not). Moreover <skt>mā} with <skt>liṅ} may express solicitude. Mrcch. III, p. 124 <skt>aye cirayati maitreyaḥ / mā nāma vaiklavyādakāryaṃ kuryāt} (Maitreya tarries long, in his distress I hope he will do nothing unbecoming). As to <skt>mā} with the future in epic poetry and in the prâkṛts, see 353 R. 4.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. When subjoined to some chief sentence, <skt>mā} admits of being translated by »lest,’’ as Mhbh. 5, 37, 45 <skt>mā vanaṃ cchinddhi savyāghraṃ mā vyāghrā nīnaśanvanāt} (do not destroy the forest with tigers, lest the tigers should disappear from the forest), cp. ibid. 1, 30, 15 quoted 353 R. 4. (*1). In other terms, <skt>mā} with <skt>liṅ}, aorist or future may be synonymous with <skt>yathā na} or <skt>yena na}. — In epic poetry <skt>na} with optative is also used = »lest;’’ instances are not rare. Mhbh. 1, 154, 35 <skt>śīghraṃ gacchāma bhadraṃ te na no vidyāt suyodhanaḥ} (let us go instantaneously, lest Duryodhana should know of us), ibid. 1, 56, 23 <skt>tat te dadyāṃ varaṃ vipra na nivartetkraturmam}, R. 2, 63, 43 <skt>taṃ prasādaya na tvāṃ śapet}, Nala. 14, 14 etc. (*2).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. <skt>na}, not <skt>mā}, is the negation to be used with the potential mood, in hypothetical sentences, in general precepts and with the <skt>liṅ} taught 343 <i>e.</span>). (*3). Nala. 13, 42 Damayantî says the conditions upon which she will be a maid-servant: <skt>ucchiṣṭaṃ naiva bhuñjīyāṃ na kuryāṃ pādadhāvanam / na cāhaṃ puruṣān anyān prabhāṣeyam}, here <skt>na}, not <skt>mā}, is in its place.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Panc. 325 <skt>mā} = »lest’’ is construed with a <i>present</span>: <skt>drāgācchāmi mā kaścin mamāpy anartho bhavati}. Instead of <skt>bhavati} one would rather expect <skt>bhavet}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>Sometimes <skt>na} is construed so even with the future in <skt>-syati}. Mhbh. 1, 146, 30 <skt>bhaimaṃ ca bilamadyaiva karavāma susaṃvṛtam / … na nas tatra hutāśaḥ saṃpradhakṣyati}.</p>

    <p><skt>mā… yadi} = »if not’’ I have met with Mâlat. IX, p. 160: <skt>akariṣyad asau pāpam atiniṣkaruṇaiva sā / mābhaviṣyam ayaṃ tatra yadi tatparipatthinī}. But <skt>mābha-} may be a false reading instead of <skt>nābha-}.</p>
