    <p>41. Acc. of the aim with passive verbs.</p>
    <p>When construed with a passive verb, the accus. of the aim sometimes remains accusative, as in Latin and Greek, sometimes it turns nominative. So it is good Sanskrit to say <skt>mayā grāmo gamyate}, <skt>mayā grāmo gantavyaḥ}. Kathâs. 25, 210 <skt>saṃprati gantavyā purī vārāṇasī mayā} (now I want to go to the city of Benares), Pat. I, 464 <skt>gaṃsyate so ‘rthaḥ} (the meaning will be understood), cp. ibid. 44 <skt>katham anucyamānaṃ gaṃsyate}, ibid. 102 <skt>grāmo bhavatā gantavyaḥ}(*1).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The acc. of the aim is not changed into the genitive, when attending a noun. It is said <skt>netā ‘śvasya srughnam} (the transporter of a horse to Srughna), with the acc. of the aim and the gen. of the object. Cp. Pat. I, p. 336.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Vernacular grammar makes no distinction at all between aim and object. Both kinds of accusative share the common appellation <i>karma</span>. Yet I greatly doubt, whether the acc. of the aim may turn nomin. when attending on the passive of all verbs of moving. I, for my part, am not aware of instances of any of them, but for <skt>gam}. The transitive compounds (43) of course are left aside, likewise such verbs, as the vaidik <skt>Iyate}, when = »to be asked for — ”.</p>
