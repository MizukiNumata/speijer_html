    <p>412. Interrogative particles.</p>
    <p>II. In such interrogative sentences, as put the whole fact into question, interrogative particles are sometimes added, sometimes omitted. When they are omitted, the verb mostly heads the sentence. When added, it is they that are usually put at the head. The said particles are <skt>api}, <skt>uta}, <skt>kim} and <skt>kiñcit}.</p>
    <p><i>a</span>). Examples of questions <i>without</span> interrog. particle: Panc. 21 <skt>bho damanaka śṛṇoṣi śabdaṃ dṛrān mahān tam} (say, Dam., do you hear a noise distant and great?), ibid. 326 <skt>asti tasya durātmanaḥ pratiṣedhopāyaḥ kaścit} (is there any means for checking that scoundrel?), Mâlav. IX, p. 159 <skt>kathaya jīvati me priyā} (say, does my sweetheart live?).</p>
    <p><i>b</span>). Examples of questions <i>with</span> interrog. particle:</p>
    <p>1. <skt>api}. — Panc. 35 <skt>api bhavataḥ śivam} (v. a. are you in good health?), ibid. 25 <skt>api satyam} (is it true?), Kathâs. 24, 208 <skt>api jānītha} (do you know?), Vikram. IV, p. 142 <skt>api dṛṣtavān asi mama priyāṃ vane}.</p>
    <p>2. <skt>uta}, in simple questions very rare and obsolete, it seems. Kâç. on P. 3, 3, 152 <skt>uta daṇḍaḥ patiṣyati} (will the stick fall?). As to its use in alternatives see 414.</p>
    <p>3. <skt>kim}. — Daç. 170 <skt>śaknoṣi kim} = Lat. <i>potesne</span>?</p>
    <p>4. <skt>kañcit}. — R. 1, 52, 7 <skt>kañcit te kuśalaṃ rājan… kañcit te vijitāḥ sarve ripavaḥ} (are you in good health; king? … have you subdued all your enemies?), Mhbh. 1, 5, 1 <skt>purāṇam akhilaṃ tāta pitā te ‘dhītavānpurā / kañcit tvam api tatsarvam adhoṣe}, cp. Nala. 4, 24, Kathâs. 75, 93 etc.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Like the other interrogatives (409, 3°) the said particles may be strengthened by adding to them some other particle as <skt>iva}, <skt>vā}, <skt>nu}, <skt>u}, <skt>nāma}. Of the kind is <skt>api nāma}, <skt>kiṃ nu}, <skt>kiṃ nu khalu}, <skt>kim iva} and the like. — Çâk. I <skt>api nāma kulapater iyam asavarṇakṣetrasaṃbhavā bhavet} (can she have been born to the chief of the family from a wife of a different caste?); ibid. VII <skt>kiṃ vā śakuntaletyasya mātur ākhyā} (is Çak. perhaps the name of his mother?); Bhoj. 64 <skt>tataḥ kavirvyacintayat / kim u rājñā nāśrāvi} (what can I see more unhappy than this?); Mhbh. 1, 151, 28 <skt>kiṃ nu duḥkhataraṃ śakyaṃ mayā draṣṭum ataḥ param}; Mhbh. 1, 162, 11 <skt>kiñcit nu duḥkhair buddhis te viluptā gatavetasaḥ}.</p>
