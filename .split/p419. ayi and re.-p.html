    <p>419. ayi and re.</p>
    <p>All interjections readily join with vocatives. Two, <skt>ayi} and <skt>re}, are especially employed so, since they serve to draw the attention of the person addressed, in a word, like <skt>bhoḥ} the vocat. of <skt>bhavān} (259) — and Lat. <i>heus</span>. Kumâras. 4, 28 <skt>ayi saṃprati dehi darśanaṃ smara} (come, Kâma, show yourself now), Hit. 9 <skt>vyāghra uvāca / śṛṇu re pāntha}. — <skt>ayi} is especially fit for gentle address »prithee. (*1)’’.</p>
    <p>A cognate particle is <skt>aye}, sometimes = <skt>ayi}, sometimes expressive of astonishment. Çak. VI king Dushyanta, when perceiving on a sudden the charioteer of Indra standing near, exclaims <skt>aye mātaliḥ}. Cp. Mrcch. I, p. 17 <skt>aye sarvakālamitraṃ maitreyaḥ prāptaḥ}.</p>

    <p><skt>ayi} is also asserted by lexicographers to be a particle of interrogation. I greatly doubt the correctness of this statement. <skt>ayi} may easily be confounded in mss. with <skt>api}, and, in fact, it is not rarely a various reading of the interrogative <skt>api}, see the passages of Çâk. quoted by the Petr. Dict. s. v. <skt>ayi} 2). The Petr. Dict. adds five more instances: <i>a</span>) three from the Kumâras., <i>b</span>) one from the Mrcch., <i>c</span>) one from the Pancatantra. Of them, <i>a</span>) Kumâras. 4, 8 <skt>ayi jīvitanātha jīvasi}, though Mallin. comments thus on it <skt>ayi praśnānunayayor iti viśvaḥ / ayi jī- jī- prāṇiṣi kañcid iti}, it is by no means necessary to accept here <skt>ayi} as an interrogative, better it is to keep to its duty as an interjection <skt>ayi jīvitanātha} »o, my Lord’’ <skt>jīvasi} »are you alive?’’ So Mallin. himself explains Kumâras. 5, 62 <skt>ayoti komalāmantraṇe}. As to the remaining passage ibid. 5, 33-35, the edition of Prof. Târanâtha has <skt>api}, not <skt>ayi}. — <i>b</span>) In the two editions of the Mrcch., I have at hand, the particle <skt>ayi} is wanting, instead of <skt>ayi jānīṣe} they have <skt>bhadra jānīṣe}. — <i>c</span>). As to Panc. p. 38, 6, quoted by the Petr. Dict. = p. 44, last line of Vidyâsâgara’s ed., this editor signifies by his very interpunction, that he considers <skt>ayi} an exclamative, not an interrogative, as he has <skt>ayi! śivaṃ bhavatyāḥ} (my dear, has no harm befallen you?).</p>
