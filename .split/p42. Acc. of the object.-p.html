    <p>42. Acc. of the object.</p>
    <p>II. The <b>acc. of the object</span>. — Upon the whole, the same category of verbs are transitive in Sanskrit as are elsewhere. Yet, some cases of discrepancy and some idiomatic turns proper to Sanskrit are to be noticed:</p>
    <p>1. Verbs of speaking may admit of the accus. of the person addressed, cp. 46; 2. Many a Sanskrit intransitive, whose English equivalent is likewise intr., may occarsionally admit of an object put in the accus.; then the translation will generally differ. Of the kind are:</p>
    <p>1. <skt>roditi} intr. to weep, tr. to weep for;</p>
    <p>2. <skt>hasati} 〃 to laugh, 〃 to laugh at;</p>
    <p>3. <skt>nandati} 〃 to rejoice, 〃 to rejoice at;</p>
    <p>4. <skt>śocati} 〃 to be sorry, 〃 to pity;</p>
    <p>5. <skt>varṣati} 〃 to rain, 〃 to rain upon;</p>
    <p>6. <skt>yudhyati} 〃 to fight, 〃 to fight;</p>
    <p>7. <skt>cintayati} 〃 to think, 〃 to think of; to reflect;</p>
    <p>8. Verbs of <i>rambling</span>, <i>erring</span>, like <skt>bhram}, <skt>aṭ} are trans. when — »to walk over, to go through”, note also such turns as <skt>mṛgayāṃ dhāvati} (he is a hunting), <skt>bhaikṣaṃ carati} (he lives by begging), — 9 <skt>namaskaroti}, <skt>namati} and its compounds, may be construed with the acc. of him to whom respect is shown. A complete list of such verbs is difficult to give. Most of them are to be known by the dictionary.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. As a rule, the said accusatives are not obligatory. So the verbs of <i>speaking</span> admit also of a dat. or locat. or <skt>prati}; — <skt>nam} and <skt>praṇam} we oftener construed with dat. or gen.; — it is said as well <skt>yudhyati śatruṇā} or <skt>śatruṇā saha} (<skt>samam} etc.) as <skt>śudhyati zatrum} and so on.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Note also the turn <skt>etan māṃ bhajati}<i> </span>(this falls to my share) and the trans. construction of <skt>puṣyati} or <skt>puṣṇāti śobhām} (<skt>lakṣmīm} etc.), see f. inst. Kumâras. 1, 25; 3, 63; Ragh. 3, 22; 4, 11.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. <skt>dīvyati} (to play) with the acc. of the wager is an idiom of the brâhmaṇa. {P. 2, 3, 60}</p>
