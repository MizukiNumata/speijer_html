    <p>421. Connective particles.</p>
    <p>The most important connective particles are five mono-syllables: <skt>ca}, <skt>vā}, <skt>u}, <skt>tu}, <skt>hi} and four dissyllables <skt>atha}, <skt>api}, <skt>iva} and <skt>uta}. Of these, <skt>ca}, <skt>api}, <skt>atha} and <skt>uta} have the most general bearing, as they are simply copulating words = „and, also, further,’’ though they often admit of some special modification of meaning, so as to get the force of adversatives, concessives etc. For the rest, <skt>vā} is the disjunctive, <skt>tu} and the archaic <skt>u} are adversatives, <skt>hi} is causal, <skt>iva} is the particle of comparison.</p>
    <p>In the classic language <skt>u} and <skt>uta} are no more used alone, but in some combinations they are, cp. 402 R. 1; 442, 2° and 4°. That <skt>api}, <skt>u} and <skt>uta} may also be interrogative particles, has been shown above 412 and 414.</p>
    <p>Side by side with the said connective particles one uses several adverbs, serving the same purpose, as <skt>aparam} and <skt>anyat} or <skt>anyac ca} „further, moreover,’’ <skt>param} „but, yet,’’ <skt>tathā} „likewise, and,’’ the conclusives <skt>tat} and <skt>tasmāt} „therefore,’’ the causal <skt>yataḥ} „for,’’ <skt>punaḥ} „on the other hand, again, but.’’ They have completely assumed the nature of conjunctions.</p>
    <p>Combinations of these particles either with each other or with other particles are excessively frequent. So <skt>ca} and <skt>api}, <skt>atha} and <skt>vā}, <skt>param} and <skt>tu} are very often combined, <skt>eva} is often added to <skt>ca}, <skt>api}, <skt>vā}, <skt>tu}. Some of them may be considered as units, as <skt>athavā} when = „indeed,’’ <skt>tathāpi} „nevertheless.’’</p>
