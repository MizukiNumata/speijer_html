    <p>As the connection of sentences is the subject-matter of the last Section of this Syntax, it will here suffice to give a succinct account of the connective particles severally, especially with regard to their linking together words within the compass of one and the same sentence.</p>

    <p>{ca.}</p>
    <p>1. <skt>ca} is the copulative particle <i>par excellence</span> „and.’’ It is as a rule subjoined to the word annexed, as <skt>rāmo lakṣmaṇaś ca}, but if it annexes a complex of words or a whole sentence, it is affixed to the first word, as <skt>pitā mātuś ca svasā} (father and mother’s sister). Panc. 225 <skt>caireṇa] kaścid dṛṣṭaḥ / dṛṣṭvā ca taṃ… cauro ‘bravīt}. This order is seldom inverted in prose (f. i. Panc. 126 <skt>rājño vakṣo dvidhā jātaṃ rājā mṛtaś ca} instead of <skt>mṛtaś ca rājā}), oftener in poetry. Nala. I, 22 <skt>nipetuste garutmantaḥ sā dadarśa ca tān gaṇān}, Kathâs. 44, 3: the preceding sentence is <skt>sa piturgṛhe… avasatsukham}, then there follows <skt>ekadā piturāsthāne sthitaś ca puruṣaṃ… dadarśa saḥ}.</p>
    <p>Sometimes in poetry <skt>ca} is put between the two links connected by it. Mhbh. 1, 148, 2 <skt>atha yudhiṣṭhiraḥ / bhīmasenārjunau cobhau yamau provāca} (then Yudh. addressed Bhîm., Arj. and the twins), M. 9, 322 <skt>iha cāmutra vardhate} (he becomes great in this world and in the other).</p>
    <p>In poets, <skt>ca} is not rarely put to each of the members connected, also in archaic prose; see f. i. Ch. Up. 1, 3, 2, and cp. <i>τε…τε</span> of Greek poets. But if it is necessary to state that the same thing is endowed with different qualities etc. at the same time, this idiom is also used in prose. Pat. I, p. 430 <skt>yājñikaś cāyaṃ caiyākaraṇaś ca} (he is an accomplished sacrificer as well as a grammarian), Prabodh. I, p. 15 <skt>modaṃ janayati ca saṃmohayati ca} (it procures joy and perplexes at the same time). — As to <skt>ca… ca} expressive of simultaneousness, see 438 R. 2.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. If three or more terms are to be connected, <skt>ca} is generally put but once, and with the last of them. Panc. 6 <skt>bhikṣayā nṛpasevayā kṛṣikarmaṇā vidyopārjanena vyavahāreṇa ca} (by begging, by attending on the prince, by agriculture, by turning one’s learning into money, and by trade), Daç. 78 <skt>subhagena ca mayā svadhanasya svagṛhasya svagaṇasya svadehasya svajīvitasya ca saiveśvarī kṛtā}. Then <skt>ca} is rarely wanting, sometimes in rhetorical style, as Pat. I, p. 431 <skt>ahar ahar nayamāno gām aśvaṃ puruṣaṃ paśum}, R. 3, 69, 32 <skt>karābhyāṃ vividhāngṛhya ṛkṣān pakṣigaṇān mṛgān}, and in some phrases, as Mrcch. I, p. 20 <skt>bhāgyakrameṇa hi dhanāni bhavanti yānti} (v. a. as soon as they have come, they disappear), Bhoj. 10 <skt>jarāṃ mṛtyuṃ bhayaṃ vyādhiṃ yo jānāsi sa pāṇḍitaḥ}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Sometimes <skt>ca} must be translated by a more energetic particle than »and.’’ It may be = »even.’’ R. 1, 1, 4 <skt>kasya bibhyati devāś ca} (of whom are even the gods afraid?), it may be a slight affirmative and even have adversative power, cp. 441.</p>
