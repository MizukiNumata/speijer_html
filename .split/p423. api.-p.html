    <p>423. api.</p>
    <p>2. <skt>api} may be 1. = „and, too, moreover, also,” 2. = „even,” 3. = „though”. Like <skt>ca}, it is commonly subjoined to the word — or first of the words — connected by it; in poets, it not rarely precedes. Examples of 1. Pat. I, p. 125 <skt>tavāśvo naṣṭo mamāpi ratho dagdhaḥ} (your horse is lost and my chariot is burnt). Panc. 246 the king of the frogs mounts on the back of the serpent Mandavisha; seeing this, the others too do so <skt>śeṣā api yathājyeṣṭhaṃ tatpṛṣṭhopari samāruruhuḥ}; Çâk. I <skt>asti naḥ saccaritaśravaṇalobhād anyad api praṣtavyam} (v. a. I would ask you once more); — of 2. Mudr. I, p. 30 <skt>na yuktaṃ prākṛtam api ripum avajñātum} (it is not advisable to despise a foe, not even a mean one); — of 3. Kathâs. 42, 28 <skt>anvagātsa ca taṃ tuṣṇīm anicchann api} (and, though reluctantly, he followed him).</p>
    <p>In poetry however, <skt>api} occasionally precedes the word it attends instead of being subjoined to it. Mhbh. 1, 76, 52 <skt>kaṃ brahmahatyā na dahed apīndram} (whom would not the hurting of a brahman consume? even Indra), Kumâras. 6, 59 Himavân says <skt>api vyāptadigantāni nāṅgāni prabhavanti me} (my limbs though stretching in all directions, have no power —), Panc. III, 92 <skt>api svarge} instead of <skt>svarge ‘pi} etc. Another instance of poetical license is such an arrangement as we have Nala. I, 30 <skt>tvam apy evaṃ nale vada} instead of <skt>tvam evaṃ nale ‘pi vada} (speak in this way also to N.).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Apart from being a connective, <skt>api} has many more meanings. It may be <i>a</span>) an interrogative particle, see 412; <i>b</span>) with imperative it strengthens the exhortation, see Kâç. on P. 1, 4, 96 <skt>api siñca} (do, pour out); <i>c</span>) it often precedes the <skt>liṅ}, when doing duty as an optative (343, b) or in the idiom mentioned 343 <i>c</span>) 5°. In these cases <skt>api} heads the sentence. — In other meanings again it is used, when subjoined to nouns of number (298), or when put to the interrogative pronouns and adverbs, see 281 and 288.</p>
    <p>Moreover <skt>api}, when of time, may be = 1. »only, but,” as <skt>muhūrtam api pratīkṣasva} (wait but for a moment), 2. »still,” f. i. Kathâs. 3, 18 <skt>bālo ‘pi} »when still a boy.”</p>
