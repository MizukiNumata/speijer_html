    <p>425. atha.</p>
    <p>4. <skt>atha} serves to introduce some new element (person, thing or fact). It may be wholly = <skt>ca}, and connect even single words, f. i. Panc. V, 11 <skt>vyādhitena saśokena cintāgrastena jantunā / kāmārtenātha mattena dṛṣṭaḥ svapno nirarthakaḥ}, here <skt>atha} is equivalent to <skt>ca}. Occasionally <skt>atha} may be a disjunctive, as Kathâs. 79, 24 <skt>jñānī śūro ‘tha vijñānī bhartāsmadduhitur mataḥ}.</p>
    <p>Its most common employment, however, is to annex a new sentence, especially if there be a change of subject;</p>
    <p>hence it is not rarely an adversative. Sometimes it introduces the apodosis, sometimes it has a temporal meaning ,,afterwards,’’ (*1) moreover it may do duty as a conditional conjunction, as will be more fully explained in the last Section of this book.</p>
    <p>Note its employment at the beginning of a book or chapter or section, where it is the traditional opening-word in profane writings, like the syllable <skt>om} in Holy Writ. Pancatantra IV f. i. commences <skt>athedam ārabhyate labdhapraṇāśaṃ nāma caturthaṃ tantram} (now begins the 4th tantra —).</p>
    <p>In prose it is the first word, but in poetry it may hold any other place.</p>

    <p>Especially in the archaic dialect. Ait. Br. 2, 25, 1 <skt>teṣām ājim yatām abhisṛṣṭānāṃ vāyur mukhaṃ prathamaḥ pratyapadyatāthendro ‘tha mitrāvaruṇāvathāśvinau} (of them — Agni reached the aim the first, <i>after him</span> Indra, then Mitra and Varuṇa, <i>then</span> the Açvins)</p>
