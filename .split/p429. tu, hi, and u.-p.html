    <p>429. tu, hi, and u.</p>
    <p><skt>tu}, <skt>hi} and the enclitic <skt>u} are, like <skt>ca} and <skt>vā}, subjoined to the first word of the sentence. <skt>hi} was at the outset an emphatic, a weak ,,indeed,’’ but generally it is a causal particle, at least in prose; <skt>tu} and <skt>u} are adversatives ,,but; on the other hand.’’ <skt>u} is no more used in the classic dialect, save when added to some other particle, as <skt>no} = <skt>na} + <skt>u}, <skt>atho} = <skt>atha} + <skt>u}, cp. 402 R. 1.</p>
