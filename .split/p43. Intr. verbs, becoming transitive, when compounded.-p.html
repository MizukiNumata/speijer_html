    <p>43. Intr. verbs, becoming transitive, when compounded.</p>
    <p>Intransitive verbs may become transitive, when being compounded with some preposition(*1); [gām anugacchati] (he goes after the cow), pass. <skt>anena gauranugamyate}. This chiefly applies to verbs, compounded with <skt>ati adhi anu upa prati}, but also to others. Examples: <skt>atikrāmati} (to transgress); <skt>adhiśete, adhyāste, adhitiṣṭhati}, cp. P. 1, 4, 46; <skt>anukampati} (to pity); <skt>anubhavati} (to partake of-, to enjoy); <skt>upajīvati} (to lire by-), <skt>upavasati} (to dwell near-); <skt>pratibhāti} (to appear to-); <skt>avalambati} and <skt>ālambati} (to rost on, to grasp), <skt>āvasati} (to inhabit), <skt>utkrāmati} (to neglect), <skt>pratyudgacchati} (to go to meet) etc.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. This influence of the preposition is even seen in the acc. attending on some compound adjectives, as a <skt>anuvrata}, <skt>unmukha} (Nala 2, 27 damayantīm anuvrataḥ, R. 2, 50, 1 ayodhyām unmukhaḥ).</p>
