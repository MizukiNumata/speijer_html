    <p>430. iva.</p>
    <p><skt>iva} ,,like, as’’ is the particle of comparison. It is always put after the standard of comparison, <skt>siṃha iva balavān} (strong like a lion). Mrcch. I, p. 48 <skt>andhasya dṛṣṭir iva puṣṭir ivāturasya mūrkhasya buddhir iva siddhir ivālasasya / svalpasmṛter vyasaninaḥ param eva vidyā / … sā pranaṣṭā} (she has disappeared, like the eight of the blind, like the health of the sick, like the wisdom of the fool, like the prosperity of the sluggard, like the learning of the dull and dissipated), Çâk. VI <skt>kañcid ahim iva vismṛtavān asi tvam} (have you perhaps forgotten it, as I have?). If the standard of comparison or the simile consists of more words, <skt>iva} likes to be put in the midst of them. Çâk. VII <skt>kiṃ nu khalu bāle ‘sminnaurasa iva putre snihyati me manaḥ}. Exceptions as to the place of <skt>iva} may occasionally be found in poets.</p>

    <p>{yathâ.}</p>
    <p>The other particle of comparison is the relative <skt>yathā}. It is especially used, if the standard of comparison is expressed by a full sentence, but it does the same duty as <skt>iva}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. It is a matter of course, that <skt>iva} and <skt>yathā} have no influence at all on the case of the noun they are construed with. Both the noun compared and the standard of comparison are put in the same case. Kumâras. 4, 25 <skt>taiḥ paridevitākṣarair hṛdaye dagdhaśarair ivāhataḥ} (struck by those lamentations, as if they were poisoned arrows); Nala. 2, 28 <skt>taṃ dṛṣṭvā… bhrājamānaṃ yathā ravim} (on seeing him who was bright like the sun).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Note the idiom <skt>ābhāsata iva} »he appears like,’’ f. i. Kumâras. 7, 3 <skt>[tatpuraṃ] svarga ivābabhāse}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. <skt>iva} and <skt>yathā} are often used in similes. In this case they may be strengthened by adding to them such epithets as <skt>sākṣāt} (in person), <skt>vigrahavant} or <skt>vigrahin} (embodied), <skt>svayam}, <skt>apara} (cp. Lat. <i>Mars alter</span>) and the like. Nala. 1, 4 the hero is said to have been an excellent archer and ruler of his subjects <skt>sākṣād iva manuḥ svayam} »as if he were Manu himself,’’ Daç. 116 a beautiful woman is called <skt>ratir iva vigrahiṇī} (the goddess Rati embodied), Mhbh. 1, 85, 5 <skt>yayātiḥ pālayām āsa sākṣād indra ivāparaḥ}. Cp. Kumâras. 6, 11, Ragh. 2, 16, Mâlav. I, p. 24, Kâm. 3, 30, etc.</p>
