    <p>In Section II-V we have treated of the different constituent elements of the sentence. This last part of the Syntax will deal with the various ways, in which sentences are linked together. Two main categories are here to be distinguished, 1. coordination, when — grammatically speaking — there is equality of rank between the sentences conjoined, 2. subordination, that is such a union, as makes one of the links depend upon the other, so as to constitute a period made up of a chief sentence and a clause or subordinate sentence. The former class is generally characterized by such particles as have been dealt with in the last chapter of the preceding Section, the latter class by relatives.</p>
    <p>Occasionally Sanskrit prefers coordination in such cases in which our language would rather use the other mode of junction, and inversely.</p>
    <p>Example of coordination in Sanskrit, subordination with us: Mrcch. III, p. 116 <skt>etadgarhitaṃ karma nindāmi ca karomi ca} (though blaming it I do it).</p>
    <p>Example of subordination in Sanskrit, coordination with us: Daç. 30 <skt>ratnaṃ tatraikamadrākṣam / tad ādāya gatvā kaṃcanādhvānamambaramaṇeratyuṣṇatayā gantum akṣamaḥ… kim api devāyatanaṃ praviṣṭaḥ} etc. In translating such sentences as this there is, as a rule, a greater deal of coordination in English, f. i. »I saw there [in the water] a jewel, I took it and went on, until being tired by the exceeding glow of the sun, I entered some temple.’’ Cp. 14, I.</p>
