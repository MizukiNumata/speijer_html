    <p>437. 3. particles.</p>
    <p>III. When treating of sentences connected by <<b>>particles</span> it is best to keep apart the logical categories.</p>

    <p>{Copulative particles.}</p>
    <p>Mere copulation is denoted by <skt>ca}, <skt>api}, <skt>atha} — either single or combined, as <skt>api ca}, <skt>cāpi}, <skt>athāpi} —, by <skt>kiṃ ca}, <skt>aparam}, <skt>anyac ca}, by <skt>tataḥ} and <skt>tataś ca}. They answer to English <i>and</span>, <i>also</span>, <i>likewise</span>, <i>moreover</span>, <i>further</span>, <i>then</span>, <i>thereupon</span> etc. They are not quite synonymous, and each of them may have its proper sphere (as <skt>tataḥ} to subjoin what is subsequent in time, <skt>kiṃ ca}, <skt>aparam}, <skt>anyac ca} to signify the importance of what is added, <skt>atha} to import a change of the scene, of the action, of the actors etc.), yet it is neither easy nor necessary to draw the boundary-lines sharply between them.</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. <skt>ca}. Daç. 83 <skt>niśi vayam imāṃ purīṃ praviṣṭā daṣṭaś ca mamaiva nāyako darvīkareṇa}; — 2. <skt>api}. Mudr. II, p. 69 <skt>priyaṃvadaka… viśramyatāṃ parijanena / tvam api svamadhikāramaśūnyaṃ kuru} (Priy., my attendants may keep their rest and you, discharge your duty); — 3. <skt>atha}. R. 3, 14, 4 <skt>sa taṃ pitṛsakhaṃ matvā pūjathāmāsa rāghavaḥ / … tasya kulamavyagramatha papraccha nāma ca}, Panc. 3 the king first spoke to Vishṇuçarman, »<i>then</span> the other replied’’ <skt>atha viṣṇuśarmā taṃ rājānamūce}, — 4. <skt>kiṃ ca}. Panc. 214 <skt>kim atra cinyate / avicāritam ayaṃ hantavyaḥ} the reasons, why he is to be killed are then given: <skt>yataḥ… kiṃ ca… uktaṃ… śrūyate ca} (for… moreover… then one says… it is also taught); — 5. <skt>aparam}. Panc. 135 <skt>madāśrayāḥ sarvā ete varākāḥ / aparaṃ svakudumbaṃ parityajya samāgatāḥ} (all these poor fellows are depending on me, besides they have left their families in order to join me), ibid.

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. <skt>atha} is not seldom= »now’’, fr. <i>or</span>.
