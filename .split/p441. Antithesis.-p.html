    <p>441. Antithesis.</p>
    <p>Antithesis may be variously denoted. In the first place it may be expressed by adversative particles, viz. <skt>tu} (429), <skt>param}, <skt>punaḥ}, also by such combinations as <skt>kiṃ tu}, <skt>paraṃ tu}, <skt>paraṃ kiṃ tu}. Further <skt>ca}, <skt>api}, <skt>atha} may be = <i>on the other hand</span>, <i>on my-</span>, <i>your-</span>, <i>his part</span>, <i>again</span> etc., or if stronger antithesis is implied, = <i>but</span>, <i>yet</span>. Nor is the asyndeton rare, in which case it is the mere arrangement of the two contrasting ideas, by which the antithesis appears, see 436.</p>
    <p>Examples: a.) antithesis expressed by adversative particles. — <skt>tu}. Mrcch. IV, p. 141 <skt>striyo hi nāma nisargādeva paṇḍitāḥ / puruṣāṇāṃ tu pāṇḍityaṃ śāstrair evopadiśyate} (womankind, indeed, are wise by nature, but to men wisdom is to be taught by manuals); — <skt>param}. Panc. 315 <skt>asty etat paraṃ tathāpi gṛhiṇī pṛcchāmi} (it is so, yet I will ask my wife nevertheless); — <skt>kiṃ tu}. Hit. 106 <skt>durgaṃ tāvad idam eva cirātsunirūpitam āste mahatsaraḥ / kiṃ tvetanmadhyadvīpe bhakṣyavastūnāṃ saṃgrahaḥ kriyatām} (well, this great lake has been very aptly chosen to be our fortress, but yon must lay up provisions in the island in the midst of it); — <skt>paraṃ tu}. Panc. 304 <skt>śāstrapāraṃ gatāḥ paraṃ tu buddhir ahitāḥ}; — <skt>paraṃ kiṃ tu}. Panc. 16 <skt>satyametatparaṃ kiṃ tu-} (this is true, but —); — <skt>punaḥ}. Panc. 72 <skt>ayaṃ śaṣpabhojī devapādānāṃ punaḥ śatravo māṃsāśinaḥ} (he is an herbivorous animal, but your enemies are carnivorous).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. <skt>punaḥ}, like <skt>tu}, is generally subjoined to the first word of the sentence. It must be kept in mind that its adversative power is but secondary; properly it means »again,’’ and may be used in the weakened meaning of »on the other hand, yet,’’ just as again in English (*1).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Of the adversative <skt>u} instances are often met with in such works as the Aitareyabrâhmaṇa and the Chândogyopanishad, occasionally even in the epic poems. It mostly joins with some particle or relative. Ait. Br. 2, 39, 11 <skt>yāvatāṃ vai sa jātānāṃ veda te bhavanti / yeṣām u na veda kim u te syuḥ} (— but those, of whom he has no knowledge, what is to become of them?), Ch. Up. 6, 4, 6 <skt>yad u… yad u}, ibid. 4, 15, 3 <skt>eṣa u} »but he.’’ Sometimes it is almost = <skt>ca}, for it has less adversative force than <skt>tu}.</p>
    <p><i>b</span>). <skt>ca}, <skt>api} or <skt>atha} = <i>but</span>, <i>yet</span>, <i>nevertheless</span>. Nala 1, 5 Bhîma bears the epithet of <skt>prajākāmaḥ}, to which are added the words <skt>sa cāprajaḥ} »beloved of his subjects [and at the same time »desiring to have children’’], <i>yet</span> childless’’. R. 3, 37, 2 <skt>sulabhāḥ puruṣā rājansatataṃ priyavādinaḥ / apriyasya ca pathyasya vaktā ca durlabhaḥ} (they who always speak things pleasant to be heard are easy to be found, <i>but</span> it is as difficult to meet with one who speaks an unpleasant yet wholesome word, as with one who listens to such a one), Mudr. III, p. 105 Câṇakya to the chief of the eunuchs <skt>aho rājaparijanasya cāṇakyasyopari vidveṣapakṣapātaḥ / atha kva kṛṣalas tiṣṭhati} (the king’s attendants are indeed Câṇakya’s enemies. <i>But</span> where is the çûdra-king?). Like­wise <skt>athavā}, cp. 426.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Yet, like »again,’’ it may occasionally head the sentence. Panc. 3 <skt>nāhaṃ vadyāvikrayaṃ śāsanaśatenāpi karomi / punar etāms tava putrānmāsaṣaṭkena yadi nītiśāstrajñān na karomi tataḥ svanāmatyāgaṃ karomi}; Daç. 181, l. 14.</p>
