    <p>45. Verbs with a double construction.</p>
    <p>Some verbs admit of a double construction, which is the counterpart of the well-known Latin idiom <i>munus mihi donat</span> = <i>munere me donat</span>. Compare for inst.</p>

    <p><skt>vibhaj}. — Mhbh. (ed. Calc. 3, 17242) <skt>dharmastu vibhajaty artham ubhayoḥ puṇyapāpayoḥ} (Dharma bestows riches on both good and wicked.)</p>
    <p>Yâjñ. 2, 114 <skt>[pitā] svecchayā vibhajet sutāñ jyeṣṭhaṃ vā śreṣṭhabhāgena} (a father may either bequeath his sons as he likes best, or he should bestow the best lot upon the eldest).</p>

    <p><skt>kṣip}. — R. (Gorr.) 5, 11, 11 <skt>dhūrtapralāpān kṣipanti} (they utter out beguiling talk).</p>
    <p>M. 8, 270 <skt>ekajātir dvijātīṃs tu vācā dāruṇayā kṣipan} (a not-dvija, when hurting a dvija with harsh words).</p>

    <p><skt>lup}. — <skt>lumpaty artham} (he robs the money).</p>
    <p><skt>lumpati svāminam}.</p>

    <p>Both constructions are used side by side in this mantra of Pâraskara (Grhy. 2, 2, 7) <skt>yenendrāya bṛhasyatir vāsaḥ paryadadhādamṛtaṃ tena tvā paridadhāmi}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The verb <skt>yaj} <i>seems</span> to offer some irregularity of construction, but in fact it is not this verb, which is dealt with in a strange way, but it is the common translation of it, which conceals its proper meaning. One is wont to translate it »to sacrifice,” but its real purport must have been some of »worshipping, honouring, feeding” or the like. Accordingly the offering is put in the instrumental, the divinity fed or worshipped in the accusative. One needs must say <skt>havirbhir devān yajāmahe} <i>τοὺς θεοὺς ἁζόμεθα θύμασι</span>. — The real equivalent of our »sacrificing” is <skt>hu} = <i>θύειγ</span>; here the divinity is a dative, and the object is <i>either</span> the fire or wheresoever the offering is poured into, or the offering itself; therefore <skt>devebhya agniṃ juhomi} or <skt>devebhya agnau havir juhomi}. — Moreover the etymol. accus. is of course also available as well with <skt>yaj} as with <skt>hu}; it may be said <skt>yajñaṃ yajāmahe}, <skt>agnihotraṃ juhomi}. But the instrum. of the offering with <skt>hu}; is vaidik according to P. 2, 3, 3 (see Pat. on that sûtra, I, p.444).</p>
