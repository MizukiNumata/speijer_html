    <p>From observing the practice of Sanskrit authors the following general rules about the relative sentences may be laid down.</p>

    <p>{Its propaties.}</p>
    <p>1. The demonstrative is chiefly the pronoun <skt>sa}, <skt>sA}, <skt>tat} and its derivatives, as <skt>tatra}, <skt>tathA}, <skt>tadA}, <skt>tataH}. Yet, it must be kept in mind that relative adverbs do not necessarily require demonstrative adverbs of the same category; in other terms, one is not compelled to use the type <skt>yataH… tataH}, <skt>yatra… tatra} alone, but sometimes some other demonstrative, f. i. a noun-case of the pronoun may answer to the relative adverb, as <skt>yatra tvam avasaH sa dezo ramaNoyaH} (it is a charming country where you dwelled).</p>
    <p>2. Sanskrit likes to put the relative sentence first. In this case we have a period consisting of a <<b>>protasis</span> or</p>
    <p>former member, which is the relative sentence, and an <<b>>apodosis</span> or latter member, the principal sentence. This order is the regular one and much more used than inserting the relative sentence in the main one, as is generally done in modern European tongues. The demonstr. is commonly expressed, sometimes it is understood.</p>
    <p>Examples : Panc. II, 20 <skt>yasmAc ca yena ca yadA ca yathA ca yac ca yAvac ca yatra ca zubhAzubhamAtmakarma / tasmAc ca tena ca tadA ca tathA ca tac ca tAvac ca tatra ca vidhAtRvazAdupaiti} (good and evil works of. the individual are so requited by the Divine Power as to reach [the performer] by the same cause, by the same agent, at the same time, in the same way, at the same spot, and to be of the same quality and quantity), M. 1, 42 <skt>yeSAM tu yAdRzaM karma bhUtAnAmiha kIrtitaM / tat tayA vo ‘bhidhAsyAmi} (now, what duties are assigned to the different beings in this world, I will tell you), Utt. III, p. 42 <skt>yatra drumA api mRgA api bandhavo me / yAni priyAsahacaraz ciram adhyavAtsam / etAni tAni bahunirpharakandarANi / godAvarIparisarasya girestaTAni}, Panc. 48 <skt>tad asya yad yujyate tat kriyatAm} (do to him that which is fit to be done).</p>
    <p>Sometimes, however, the relative sentence follows after the principal one. In this case, the demonstrative is often omitted. Mrcch. I, p. 19 <skt>etat tu mAM dahati yadgRham asmadIyaM / kSINArthamityatithayaH parivarjayanti} (this ails me, that —), Nala. 2, 25 <skt>sarve [sc. lokapAlAH]… vidarbhAnabhijagmuste yataH sarve mahokSitaH} (all of them went to Vidarbha, whither all princes were on their way).</p>
    <p>3. Like the interrogative (280), the relative may be part of a compound. Mrcch. III, p. 111 <skt>yadvismayaM yAnti paurAH} = <skt>yasya vismayaM-}, Ch. Up. 4, 4, 2 <skt>sAham etan na veda yadgotras tvam asi} (I do not know of what gotra you are), Ven. II, p. 44 <skt>tadAdezaya tam uddezaM yatrasthA bhAnumatI}.</p>
    <p>4. Nothing prevents the relative depending on a gerund, participle or absolute case. Ch. Up. 5, 1, 7 <skt>te ha prANAH prajApatiM pitaram etyocur bhagavan ko naH zreSTha iti / tAnhovAca yasminva utkrAnte zarIraM pApiSThataramiva dRzyeta sa vaH zreSTha iti} (the [five] senses went to their father Prajâpati and said: »Sir, who is the beet of us?’’ He replied: »he by whose departure the body seems worse than worst, he is the beet of you’’), Bhoj. 26 <skt>nagaraM vilokya kamapi mUrkhamamAtyo nApazyadyaM nirasya viduSe gRhaM dIyate} (the minister looked about the town, but did not find any illiterate person to expel from his house, in order to give it to a man of learning). — Kumâras. 1, 3 the pronoun <skt>yasya} is to be construed with the former part of a tatpurusha <skt>yasya himaM na saubhAgyavilopi jAtam} (v. a. whose happiness [of Himavân] is not disturbed by the snow), Mrcch. III, p. 111 the thief speaks: <skt>tatkasmindeze darzayAmyAtmazilpaM / dRSTvA zvo yaM yadvismayaM yAnti paurAH} (on what spot, then, shall I show my skill, which the citizens will admire to-morrow when looking at it?).</p>
    <p>5. In prose, the relative is, as a rule, the first word of the relative sentence. Panc. 53 <skt>yatra kanyAntaHpure vAyuM muktvA nAnyasya pravezo ‘sti tatra-}, ibid. 62 <skt>yaiH sahAhaM vRddhiM gataH sadaiva krIDitaz caite-} (they, with whom I always stayed, with whom I grew up and played —). In poetry it may be put anywhere. Varâh. Brh. 32, 4 the Earth says to the Creator <skt>bhagavan nAma mamaitat tvAyA kRtaM yadacaleti tan na tathA} (o Lord, the name of firmness which thou hast bestowed upon me, is vain). The çlokas I, 54-63 of the Pancatantra, which have been quoted for a different purpose on page 266 of this book, may also give some illustration of the poetical license in putting the relative; in one çloka (vs. 62) the relative heads the sentence, in two it is wanting, the seven others exhibit the utmost variety. (*1) Panc. I, 414 the relative sentence runs thus: <skt>narAdhipA nIcajanAnuvartino budhopadiSTena pathA na yAnti ye}. R. 2, 28, 26 we have this order <skt>vanaM tu netuM na kRtA matiryadA babhUva rAmeNa tadA mahAtmanA / na tasya sItA vacanaM cakAra} instead or <skt>yadA tu rAmeNa vanaM netuM matirna kRtA tadA sItA tasya vacanaM na cakAra}.
