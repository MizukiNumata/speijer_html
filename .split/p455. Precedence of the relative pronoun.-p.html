    <p>455. Precedence of the relative pronoun.</p>
    <p>The general rules laid down in 453 for all kinds of relative sentences are especially applicable to those whose relative is the pronoun <skt>ya} itself. It is, therefore, regular to make the relative precede. In Sanskrit, as a rule, it is not the demonstrative which is the antecedent of the relative, but inversely. Panc. 319 <skt>meSa] eko… mahAnase pravizya yatpazyati tatsarvaM bhakSayati / te ca sUpakArA yatkiMcitpAtraM pazyanti tenAzu tADayanti}, Mudr. V, p. 180 <skt>ya Aryas taM pRccha vayam idAnIm anAryAH saMvRttAH} (ask one who is a honourable man, not me who have now turned dishonest), Bhoj. 9 <skt>ye mayA niyamA upavAsAz ca tvatkRte kRtAste ‘dya me viphalA jAtAH} (the penances and fasts which I have performed in your behalf, have now proved fruitless).</p>
    <p>This precedence is, indeed, but the consequence of the entire employment of relative pronouns in Sanskrit composition. They are not used, as in many other languages, where the relative sentence may be a concurrent idiom of participles and adjectives and a means for paraphrasing. But in Sanskrit only such attributes as are of importance to the understanding of the main sentence, are fit for analytical expression by means of relative sentences. (*1)</p>
