    <p>457. Inverted order.</p>
    <p>If the relative sentence <i>follows</span>, the inverted order may be accounted for by some special reason. Mrcch. IV, p. 138 <skt>apaNDitAste puruSA matA me ye strISu ca zrISu ca vizvasanti} (I hold those unwise, who rely on women and fortune), here the stress laid on the predicate <skt>apaNDitAH} has caused the chief sentence to be placed before. Likewise Kumâras. 2, 51 the gods entreat Brahmâ <skt>tadicchAmo vibho straSTuM senAnyaM tasya (sc. tArakasya) zAntaye… goptAraM sarvasainyAnAM yaM puraskRtya gotrabhit / pratyAneSyati zatrubhyo vandImiva jayazriyam}. The opening-line of the Kumârasambhava is <skt>astyuttarasyAM dizi devatAtmA himAlayo nAma nagAdhirAjaH} etc., the glory and the magnificence of Himavân are extolled in the following sixteen çlokas (1, 2-17) each of them adding a new ornament to his splendour. In all of them it is the relative alone, which connects the different links of the eulogy, referring as it does to the preceding <skt>himAlayaH} of the chief sentence in çl. 1. And so often, if somebody or something is characterized by a series of clauses, the relative sentences follow after the main sentence. In the last instances quoted the demonstrative in the main sentence is wanting and it is the noun alone that does duty as what we are wont to call the relative’s antecedent. Sometimes, however, it may happen that there is no other antecedent to be supplied than just the wanting demonstr. R. 3, 19, 7 <skt>na hi pazyAmyihaM loke yaH kuryAn mama vipriyam} (I am not aware of [anybody] in the world, who can do evil to me).</p>
