    <p>The relative pronoun must follow the main sentence, if it introduces a cause o a special character, especially a causal one, yet it may also import a <i>consequence</span>, a <i>disposition</span>, or even a <i>purpose</span>. In other terms, the relative pronoun is sometimes used, where one would expect a relative adverb or conjunction, <skt>yaH} being almost = <skt>yatsa} (that he) or = <skt>yathA sa} (in order that he), or = <skt>yAdRzaH} (such as to —). Cp. Lat. <i>qui</span> = <i>quum is</span> and <i>qui</span> = <i>ut is</span>.</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) The relative clause implies a cause, motive or reason. So especially after such verbs and nouns as signify a disposition either glad or sad, either benevolent or malevolent, either content or discontent, and the like.

In these examples from the classic dialect the present is used or the future. In the old and epic style such clauses require the optative mood (<skt>liG}) cp. 344 <i>f</span>), Mhbh. 1, 157, 25 <skt>nahi yogaM prapazyAmi yena mucyeyamApadaH} (I see no means, indeed, how to get rid of distress), R. 1, 54, 3 <skt>parityaktA vasiSThena kimahaM sumahAtmanA / yAhaM rAjabhRtairdainA hriyeya bhRzaduHkhitA} (why has V. left me, to be captured by the king’s attendants?), ibid. 3, 13, 11 <skt>vyAdiza me dezaM sodakaM bahukAnanam / yatrAzramapadaM kRtvA kRtvA vaseyaM nirataH sukham}.</p>
