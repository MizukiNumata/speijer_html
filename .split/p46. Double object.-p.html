    <p>46. Double object.</p>
    <p>Now, some verbs have the faculty of admitting two objects at the same time.</p>
    <p>It is said as well <skt>kathāṃ vakti} (he tells a story) as <skt>tvāṃ vakti} (he speaks to you); as well <skt>śatruṃ jayati} (he vanquishes the enemy) as <skt>rājyaṃ jayati} (he conquers a kingdom); as well <skt>śiṣyam anuśāsti} (he teaches his pupil) as <skt>dharmam anuśāsti} (he teaches the law). By combining both constructions we obtain 1. <skt>kathāṃ vakti tvām}; 2. <skt>śatruṃ rājyaṃ jayati}; 3. <skt>śiṣyaṃ dharmam anuśāsti}.</p>
    <p>This double object may attend a.) verbs of <i>speaking</span>, as <skt>√brū}, <skt>√vac}, <skt>√ah} etc., <i>asking</span>, as <skt>√yāc}, <skt>√bhikṣ}, <skt>pra√arth}, <skt>√prach} and sim., <i>teaching</span>, especially <skt>anu√śās} and <skt>adhi√āp}, b.) some others, especially <skt>√ji} (<i>to win</span>), <skt>√duh} (<i>to milk</span>), <skt>√daṇḍ} (<i>to punish</span>, <i>to fine</span>). See P. 1, 4, 51 with the commentaries.</p>
    <p>Examples: speaking: Nala 1, 20 <skt>tato ‘ntarikṣago vācaṃ vyājahāra nalaṃ tadā}, R. 2, 52, 31 <skt>ārogyaṃ brūhi kosalyām}; — <i>asking, begging</span>: Ch. Up. 5, 3, 5 <skt>pañca mā rājavandhuḥ praśnān aprākṣit} (that fellow of a râjanya asked me five questions), M. 8, 87 <skt>sākṣyaṃ pṛcched ṛtaṃ dvijān}, Kathâs. 1, 31 <skt>sa varaṃ mām ayācati} (he requested a boon of me), Mhbh. 1, 56, 24 <skt>suvarṇaṃ rajataṃ gāś ca na tvāṃ rājan vṛṇomy aham} (I do not beg gold of you, my king, nor silver, nor cows); <i>teaching</span> R. 2, 39, 27 <skt>kariṣye sarvam evāham āryā yad anuśāsti} (I will do all that, which Mylady enjoins me to do); — <skt>ji} : Mhbh, 3, 59, 5 <skt>niṣadhān pratipadyasva jitvā rājyaṃ nalaṃ nṛpam}; —</p>
    <p><skt>duh}: Kumâr. 1, 2 <skt>bhāsvanti ratnāni mahīṣadhīś ca — duduhur dharitrīm} (they milked from the earth resplendent gems and herbs of great medicinal power); — <skt>daṇḍy}: M. 9, 234 <skt>tān sahasraṃ daṇḍyet} (he should punish them with a fine of a thousand paṇa).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Indian grammar adds to them some others, instances of which construed with a double object are scarcely met with in literature, if at all. Of the kind are <skt>ci} (to gather), <skt>rudh} (to check), <skt>muṣ} (to rob), <skt>math} (to churn), thus exemplified: <skt>vṛkṣam avacinoti phalāni / gām avaruṇaddhi vrajam / sudhāṃ kṣīranidhiṃ mathnāti} etc(*1).</p>

    <p>Here also vernacular grammarians put the two accus., depending on such verbs, as <skt>nī}, <skt>vah}, see 40 R.</p>
