    <p>466. yat, when final or consecutive.</p>
    <p><skt>yat}, common as it is as a causal particle, is somewhat rarely found as a final or consecutive conjunction, <i>that</span> = »in order that,” or = »in consequence of which.” Panc. 199 <skt>kriyatAM teSAM kRte kAcid bibhISikA yatkathamapi daivAnna samAyAnti} (frighten them in some way or other, that perchance they may not return somehow), Kâç. on P. 3, 2, 36 explains <skt>asUryaMpazyA rAjadArAH} in this way <skt>evaM nAma guptA yatsUryamapi na pazyanti} (being indeed so closely guarded as not to see the sun), Kumâras. 1, 37 <skt>etAvatA yat} (in so much that). Cp. Mrcch. V, p. 201, where Cârudatta exclaims <skt>varSazatamastu durdinamaviratadhAraM zatahradA sphuratu / asmadvidhadurlabhayA yadahaM priyayA pariSvaktaH} (let the rain descend incessantly and let the lightning flash for ever, in consequence of which I hold my beloved in my arms, her who was unattainable to somebody like me).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Mahâv. II, p. 21 the râxasa says <skt>anartha eva vo yatkanyeyamanyasmai dIyata iti}, the literal sense of which is »to give her to another is mischief to you,” but when translating more freely »woe to you, <i>if</span> she should be given to another.” In the archaic dialect <skt>yat} is occasionally a full synonym of <skt>yadi}. Only see these passages of the Chândogya-upanishad: 5, 15, 2 <skt>saMdehaste vyazIryadyanmAM nAgamiSyaH} (your body would have perished, if you had not come to me), and 6, 11, 2 <skt>yadekAM zAkhAM jIvo jahAtyatha zuSyati} (if the life leaves one of the branches [of the tree], that branch withers).</p>
    <p>In this passage of Âçval. Gṛhyas. (3, 4, 7) <skt>tasya dvAvanAdhyAyau yadAtmAzuciryad dezaH} (the cases of prohibition to study Holy Writ are twofold: impurity of person and impurity of place) <skt>yat} may be accepted = »if,” but one may also account for it by referring to the idiom mentioned in the foot-note on p. 358.</p>
