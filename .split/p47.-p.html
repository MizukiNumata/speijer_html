    <p>Yet, with none of the said verbs the double accusative is of necessity. Other constructions are quite as usual, sometimes even preferable, especially in simple prose. The verbs of <i>asking</span> are often construed with the <i>ablat.</span> or <i>genit.</span> of the person addressed. Those of <i>teaching</span> admit of acc. of the person + loc. of the thing taught (Priy. p.11 <skt>gītanṛtyavādyādiṣu…śikṣayitavyā}), <skt>ādiśati}, <skt>saṃdiśati} and other verbs of <i>enjoining</span> are construed with acc. of the enjoinment + dat. (or its substitutes) of the person. Those of <i>speaking</span> are often construed with the dative of the person addressed, or the genitive, or [prati].</p>
    <p>NB. Some verbs as <skt>kathayati} (to tell), <skt>vedayati} (to make known), <skt>ādiśati} (to enjoin) never comply with the double object.</p>
