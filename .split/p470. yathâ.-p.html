    <p>470. yathâ.</p>
    <p>The employment of <skt>yathA} bears a great resemblance to that of Latin <i>ut</span>. Like this, <skt>yathA} has originally been a particle of comparison „as,’’ the correlative of which is the demonstrative „so, thus.’’ Yet its duty is not limited to the expression of equation, but extends to many other logical relations, chiefly <i>consequence</span> and <i>purpose</span> or <i>aim</span>, though it may answer sometimes our causal or merely epexegetical „that.’’</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) When used in its proper sense for the sake of comparison, the parallelism of <skt>yathA… tathA} or its synonyms (<skt>evam}, <skt>ittham}) is frequent, although the omission of the demonstr. is not excluded. Pat. I, p. 51 <skt>yathecchasi tathAstu} (be it so, as you desire), Utt. II, p. 27 <skt>vitarati guruH prAjJe vidyAM yathaiva tathA jaDe} (the teacher bestows his learning on his sluggish disciple just as he does on the keen-witted one), R. 3, 19, 18 <skt>imAmavasthAM nItAhaM yathA ‘nAthA ‘satI tathA} (I am reduced to this state, as [if I were] a woman of bad conduct who has no protector), Hit. 108 <skt>evamanuSTheyaM davacanaM yathA}; — demonstr. omitted: Nala. 22, 4 <skt>brUyAz cainaM kathAnte tvaM parNAdavacanaM yathA} (speak to him as Parnâda spoke), Mhbh. 4, 2, 5 <skt>maMsyante mAM yathA nRpam} (they will consider me like a king).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. <skt>yathA} may also be = »in so far as.’’ R. 3, 5, 18 Râma admires the knightly attitude and the vigour of Indra and his men, who appear like youths of twenty-five, <skt>rUpaM bibhrati} says he to Laxmaṇa <skt>saumitre paJcaviMzativArSikam… yatheme puruSavyAghrA dRzyante priyadarzanAH} (they bear the shape of youths of twenty-five, in so far as we may judge from their outward appearance). Hence <skt>na tathA} = Lat. <i>non tam… quam</span>, 1. »not so much… as,’’ f. i. Kumâras. 5, 37 <skt>tathA na gAGgaiH salilairdivazcyutaiH / yathA tvadIyaiz caritair anAvilair mahIdharaH pAvita eSa sAnvayaH}, 2. »not exactly… but,’’ f. i. M. 2, 96 <skt>na tathaitAni [sc. indriyANi] zakyante saMniyantum asevayA / viSayeSu prajuSTAni yathA jJAnena nityazaH}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. In protestations and oaths <skt>yathA… tena satyena} = »as sure as… so surely.’’ R. 2, 64, 40 <skt>apApo ‘si yathA putra nihataH pApakarmaNA / tena satyena gacchAzu ye lokAstvastrayodhinAm} (as sure as you being sinless have been killed, my son, by an evil-doer, so surely may you go swiftly to the abodes of the warriors), cp. Nala. 5, 16-20.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. <skt>yathA} with <skt>liG} may be = »as if’’ (343, <i>d</span>). Ch. Up. 5, 24, 1 <skt>yathAGgArAnapohya bhasmani juhuyAttAdRktatsyAt} (this would be as if a man were to remove the (live] coals and pour his libation in [dead] ashes. R. 3, 51, 34 the vulture Jatâyu is said to have fallen upon Râvaṇa in the same way »as if some mahaunt mounts a wicked elephant’’ <skt>adhirUDho gajAroho yathA syAd duSTavAraNam}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 4. <skt>yadvat… tadvat} are equivalent to <skt>yathA… tathA}. With optative <skt>yadvat} is also = »as if.’’ Varâh. Bṛh. 2, 19 <skt>nagaradvAraloSTasya yadvatsyAdupayAcitam / AdezastadvadajJAnAm} (a prediction by ignorant men is as useless as if one were to question a clod of earth at the town-gate).</p>
