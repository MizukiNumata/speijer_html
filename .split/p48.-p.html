    <p>In the passive construction the <i>person</span> asked, addressed, defeated etc. turns <i>nominative</span>, the <i>thing</span> asked for, spoken etc. remains <i>accusative</span>. Therefore, though it may be said separately <skt>ukto ‘rthaḥ} as well as <skt>uktas tvam}, <skt>pṛṣṭo vṛttāntaḥ} as well as <skt>pṛṣṭāḥ putrāḥ}, when combined, we get the type <skt>etam artham uktas tvam / pṛṣṭāḥ putrā vṛttāntam}. Examples: Panc. 29 <skt>prārthito mayā bhavadarthe svāmy abhayapradānam} (v. a. I have asked my master to grant you his protection), Kathâs. 27, 142 <skt>bāṇena yuddhayogyam ariṃ haro yācitaḥ} (Bâṇa has prayed Çiva for a foe, fit to fight with); — R. 2, 97, 15 <skt>na hi te niṣṭḥuraṃ vācyo bharato nāpriyaṃ vacaḥ}; — Daç, 80 <skt>mayā jitaścāsau ṣoḍaśasahasrāṇi dīnārāṇām}; — M. 8, 36 <skt>anṛtaṃ tu vadandaṇḍhyaḥ svavittasyāṃśam aṣṭamam} (but when bearing false witness, he must be punished with a fine of one eighth of his goods).</p>
    <p>This passive construction is often avoided(*1) by employing one of the concurrent idioms, taught in 47. Therefore <skt>uktam idaṃ tvām prati} or <skt>tubhyam}, or <skt>mayāyam arthas tvattaḥ pṛṣṭaḥ} or <skt>tvat sakāśāt} etc.</p>

    <p>With some verbs it is, if at all, but rarely met with. Upon the (the) whole, the construction with a double object appears to be the remnant of an old vegetation, which has almost passed away to be succeeded by new stalks and young stems. We may see the same process at work in Latin, Greek and the teutonic languages. In all of them the idiom of the double object loses territory time going.</p>
