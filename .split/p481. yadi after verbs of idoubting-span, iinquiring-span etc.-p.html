    <p>481. yadi after verbs of <i>doubting</span>, <i>inquiring</span> etc.</p>
    <p><skt>yadi} (if) is chiefly employed in the protasis of conditional periods. This main function will be treated in the following chapter. But, moreover, like our „if,’’ Greek <i>εἰ</span>, Lat. <i>si</span>, <skt>yadi} serves to introduce the relative sentence which is the object of verbs of <i>doubting</span>, <i>inquiring</span>, <i>observing</span>, <i>expecting</span>, <i>telling</span> and the like. <skt>pazyAmi yadi} = „I will see if (whether).’’</p>
