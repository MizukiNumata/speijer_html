    <p>Sometimes the clause with <skt>yadi} is used in a somewhat elliptical way, viz. without apodosis. Çâk. VII Dushyanta considers whether he shall ask the boy, whom he already suspects to be his son, about the name of his mother: <skt>yadi tAvad asya zizor mAtaraM nAmataH pRccheyam} (if I should ask now the name of his mother?). In a similar way, if hope is uttered. R. 2, 59, 3 <skt>AzayA yadi mAM rAmaH punaH zabdApayed iti} (hoping: »perhaps Râma will again address me’’), ibid. 3, 54, 3 Sîtâ when being carried away by Râvaṇa casts off her upper-garment and her jewels among a little band of apes <skt>yadi rAmAya zaMseyur iti} (perhaps they will show them to Râma). (*1). Such sentences require the optative (<skt>liG}) because of the nature of their contents. A different character is displayed by such ellipsis, as is shown R. 3, 17, 21, where Çûrpanakhâ says to Râma <skt>rAvaNo nAma me bhrAtA yadi te zrotramAgataH} (my brother is named Râvaṇa, whom perhaps you will have heard of).
