    <p>485. na cet.</p>
    <p><skt>na cet} is rather to be looked upon as a unity, like Latin <i>nisi</span>. Daç. 97 <skt>na cedajinaratnaM pratiprayacchasi na ced vA nAgarikebhyaz coritakAni pratyarpayasi drakSyasi pAramaSTAdazAnAM kAraNAn Amante ca mRtyumukham} (if you do not give back the magic skin, or if you do not restore to the townsmen the objects, you have stolen from them, you shall pass through the eighteen kinds of torture and finally you shall see the door of Death).</p>

    <p>{no cet.}</p>
    <p>Instead of <skt>na cet} it is also said <skt>no cet}, that is <skt>na} + the advers. <skt>u} + <skt>cet}, but the adversative force of <skt>u} is not always conspicuous. R. 3, 40, 26 <skt>no cetkaroSi mArIca hanmi tvAm aham adya vai} (if you do not do it, forsooth, I’ll kill you to day).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Note <skt>no cet} making up the whole protasis. So it is especially used in threatening like Lat. <i>si minus</span>, Germ. <i>widrigenfalls</span>, f. i. Panc. 76 <skt>evaM jJAtvA tvayaiSa vadhyaH / no cettvAM vyApAdayiSyati} (you must kill him, otherwise he will kill you). For the rest, <skt>anyathA} is equally good. Panc. 124 <skt>samarpaya me sutamanyathA rAjakule nivedayiSyAmi} (surrender me my son, otherwise I will prefer charges with the king’s court).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. The very opposite of <skt>no cet} is <skt>yady evam} which is likewise often used by itself. It expresses concession and assent »if that is so’’ v. a. »in that case.’’ Daç. 101 <skt>yadyevamehi… tvAmahaM mocayiSyAmi} (in that case, come, I will set you free).</p>
