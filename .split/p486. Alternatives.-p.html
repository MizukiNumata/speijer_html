    <p>486. Alternatives.</p>
    <p>When proposing an alternative, it may be said <skt>yadi… yadi}, like Latin <i>sive… sive</span>, or <skt>yadi} + adversative particle. But commonly the relative is wanting in the second protasis, and instead of it the adversative is employed alone, especially <skt>atha} or its compounds (<skt>athavA}, <skt>atha tu}, <skt>athApi}). In other terms, <skt>atha} etc. are virtually the Sanskrit expression of <i>but if</span>, Lat. <i>sin</span>.</p>
    <p>Examples of 1. <skt>yadi} retained in the second protasis. Panc. 85 <skt>svAmin yady abhayapradAnaM dattvA vadhaH kriyate tadeSa doSo bhavati / punar yadi devapAdAnAM bhaktyA sa Atmano jIvatavyaM prayacchatitanna doSaH} (Lord, if you kill him, to whom you have granted security, it is a sin, but if from attachment to your Lordship he offers you his own life, it is not; a sin), cp. Panc. 45, l. 13 <skt>yadi… athavA yadi}.</p>
    <p>2. <skt>atha} etc.= »but if, and if.’’ Pat. I, p. 8 <skt>yadi santi nAprayuktA athAprayuktA na santi santi cAprayuktAz ceti vipratiSiddham} (if they are, they [can]not [be said to be] not employed, and if they are not employed, they are not; [to say,] they are and at the same time one does not employ them, is a self-contradictory statement); — Çâk. V <skt>yadi yathA vadati kSitipas tathA tvam asi kiM pitur utkulayA tvayA / atha tu vetsi zuci vratam AtmanaH patikule tava dAsyam api kSamam} (if thou art what the king says, what will thy father care for thee, who hast disgraced thy family? But if thou knowest thyself chaste and pure, even slavery in thy husband’s house is to be borne by thee); — Panc. 172 <skt>yadi te dhanena prayojanamabhakSitena tatastvAmapi guptadhanaM karomi / athavA dattabhogyena dhanena te prayojanaM tadupabhuktadhanaM karomi} (if you want riches not to enjoy them, I will make you [like] Guptadhana, but if you want riches which give enjoyment, I will make you [like] Upabhuktadhana).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Sometimes in an alternative the former assumption is not expressed in the shape of a conditional period. Yet even then <skt>atha} = <i>but if</span>, Lat. <i>sin</span> is nevertheless available. R. 2, 60, 3 Kausalyâ, the mother of Râma, entreats his charioteer Sumantra to conduct her into the forest to Râma, Sîtâ and Laxmaṇa, <skt>atha}, she adds, <skt>tAnnAnugacchAmi gamiSyAmi yamakSayam} (but, if I do not reach them, I will die). Çâk. VII Dushyanta being informed by the nurse: »nobody except his father, his mother or himself is allowed to take up the magic herb of the boy Sarvadamana,’’ asks <skt>atha gRhNAti} (and if one should take it up —).</p>
