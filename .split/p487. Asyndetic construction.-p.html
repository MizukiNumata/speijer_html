    <p>487. Asyndetic construction.</p>
    <p>Occasionally the protasis of a conditional period is not introduced by any particle at all. This asyndetic construction is not very common, but it exists in Sanskrit, as it does in many other languages. Just as we say: <i>should he have done it</span> = <i>if he should</span> etc., or as the Latin poet Horace (Epp. 1, 1, 33) <i>fervet avaritia miseroque cupidine pectus: sunt verba et voces, quibus hunc lenire dolorem possis</span>, so the Sanskrit poet, quoted Hit. 98, writes <skt>khalaH karoti durvRttaM nUnaM phalati sAdhuSu} (should a rascal do evil, the consequences will certainly be felt by honest people (*1).</p>
    <p>2. Another type of asyndetic connection is that exemplified Mrcch. V, p. 184 <skt>meghA varSantuM garjantu muJcantvazanimeva vA / gaNayanti na zItoSNaM ramaNAbhimukhAH} (the clouds may pour out rain, thunder and lightning, women who are going to their sweethearts do not care for the weather). Here the protasis is expressive of the possible obstacles and still the chief action passes. The imperative in the protasis is, it seems, not necessary, cp. Panc. V, 25 <skt>zUraH surUpaH subhagaz ca vAgmI zastrANi zAstrANi vidAMkaroti / arthaM naiva yazaz ca mAnaM prApnoti martyA ‘tra manuSyaloke} (suppose one to be gallant, well-shapen, happy in love, eloquent, a master at all kind of arms and in all branches of learning, yet, without money no man on earth will achieve glory or honor).</p>
    <p>3. A third type of asyndetic construction is an imperative followed by a future, when exhorting to an action and foretelling its result, f. i. <i>do so and you will be happy</span> = do so, [for if you do so] you will be happy. So R. 1, 46, 5 Kâçyapa says to Diti <skt>zucirbhava tapodhane / janayiSyasi putraM tvaM zakrahantAramAhave}.</p>

    <p>Compare Pat. I, p. 31 <skt>eko ‘ndho darzane asamarthas tatsamudAyaz ca zatam apy asamartham} »one blind man being unable to see, a collection of blind ones will likewise be unable.’’</p>
