    <p>488. Tenses and moods in conditional periods.</p>
    <p>As to the tenses and moods, employed in the conditional period, it is to be kept in mind that the conditional period does not import an absolute statement, but rather an assertion in such a manner, that its correctness is made to depend upon the correctness of some other statement presupposed. Now, we must distinguish according to the intention of the speaker, between three cases: 1. the speaker neither affirms nor denies the reality of the fact supposed, 2. he presupposes something known to himself and to his audience to be a real fact, 3. he assumes something impossible or at least improbable, at all events something not real. Hence it follows, from a logical point of view there are three categories of conditional periods:</p>
    <p>1째. those, whose protases contain a condition, which the speaker leaves undecided whether it be correct or not;</p>
    <p>2째. such as warrant the correctness of the main assertion by the well-known correctness of the protasis;</p>
    <p>3째. those, whose protases import an evident untruth, in other terms, such as affirm what would happen if some fact occurred or had occurred, which however cannot or will not occur or have occurred.</p>
    <p>In the first and second categories the fact presupposed is put in the same tense or mood, as would be required, if it were really asserted. In other terms: the employment of past, present and future tenses, of indicative, imperative and <skt>liG} is determined by the <i>general</span> character of their significance and idiosyncrasy, which has been treated in Chapt. III of the fourth Section. That the present often, sometimes also the optative (<skt>liG}), are used instead of a future tense, can scarcely be said to be an exception, cp. 468 and 324, 1째.</p>
