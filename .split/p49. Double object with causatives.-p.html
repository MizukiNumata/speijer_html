    <p>49. Double object with causatives.</p>
    <p><b>Accusative with causative verbs</span>. — If the primitive be an <i>intransitive</span> verb, its causative is construed with with the accusative of its (the primitive’s) subject. Prim. <skt>śete devadattaḥ} Caus. <skt>yajñadatto devadattaṃ śāyayati}. The same applies to verbs of <i>going</span>; then we will have occasionally two accusatives, one of the aim and the other, pointing out the primitive’s subject. Prim. <skt>devadatto pāṭalipurtaṃ gacchati} Caus. <skt>rājā devadattaṃ pāṭaliputraṃ gamayati}.</p>
    <p>But if the primitive be a <i>transitive</span>, there is diversity of idiom {P. 1, 4, 52.}. Often the primitive’s subject is in the same manner put in the accusative, when construed with the causative, but often also in the instrumental. In the former case we have of course two accusatives, as Kathâs. 9, 10 <skt>mantrapūtaṃ caruṃ rājñīṃ prāśayan munisattamaḥ} (the best of ascetics made the queen eat a consecrated porridge), wherewith cp, this instance of the instrumental: Mhbh. 2, 1, 7 <skt>na śakṣyāmi kiñcit kārayituṃ tvayā} (I shall not be able to get anything done by you). The difference of both constructions is determined by the diverse nature of the notions, carried by them. If one wants to say <i>he causes me to do something</span>, <i>it is by his impulse I act</span>, there is room for the type <skt>māṃ kiñcit kārayati}, but if it be meant <i>he gets something done by me, I am only the agent or instrument through which he acts</span>, the instrumental is on its place <skt>kiñcit kārayati mayā}.</p>
    <p>Examples: a.) of two accusatives; Mudr. I, p.43 <skt>api kadāciñ candragupnadoṣā atikrāntapārthivaguṇāndhunā smārayanti prakṛtīḥ} (do not the vices of Candrag. still remind the people of the former kings?), Daç. 144 <skt>pitarau tasyā dārikāyā māṃ pāṇim agrāhayetām} (my parents allowed me to wed that girl), Mhbh. 1, 75, 28 <skt>sa ṛṣīn karam adāpayat} (he made the holy men pay taxes), R. 2, 55, 17 <skt>rāmas tām adhyāropayat plavam} (he ordered her to embark), ibid. 2, 94, 2 <skt>atra dāśarathiś citraṃ citrakūṭam adarśayat / bhāryām}, Daç. 215 <skt>jñāpaya māṃ svavārttām}. — So always <skt>adhyāpayati kaṃcit kiṃcit}, for this verb at the same time formally is a causative and as to its meaning (<i>to teach</span>) it belongs to the category, mentioned in 46.</p>
    <p>b.) of the instrumental of the primitive’s subject: Daç. 170 <skt>sā tasya sādhoś citravadham ajñena rājñā samādeśayāṃ cakāra} (she obtained an order of the king who was unaware [of what had happened before] to put to death this honest man); Mudr. I, p. 37 <skt>lekhaṃ śakaṭadāsena lekhayitvā} (after having got written the letter by Çakatadâsa); Panc. 51 <skt>rathakāra āpnapuruṣaistaṃ svagṛham ānāyayat} (the cartwright let him bring home by friends), Kumâras. 6, 52 <skt>sa tair ākrāmayām āsa śuddhāntam} (he [Himavân] suffered his zenana to be entered by them, that is »he opened his zenana to them”), M. 8, 371 <skt>tāṃ śvabhiḥ khādayedrājā} (her the king should order to be devoured by dogs)(*1).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Pâṇini gives a different rule about the construction of the causatives. In his sûtra 1, 4, 52 he teaches that the primitive’s subject is the karma of the causatives of a.) all intransitives, b.) the verbs of <i>going</span> (<i>moving</span>), c.) those of <i>perceiving</span> and <i>knowing</span> (<skt>buddhi}) d.) those of <i>feeding</span>, e.) those of <i>uttering voice</span>, and the following rule declares »optionally also with <skt>kārayati} and <skt>hārayati} [and their compounds, see Pat. I, p.109, 1. 10].</p>
    <p>With the other causatives, therefore, the primitive’s subject is not considered an object (karma), accordingly not put in the accus., but in the instrumental, according to P. 1, 4, 55 compared with 2, 3, 18. Now, to these rules of Pâṇini, which do not take account of the internal difference existing by necessity between the two conceptions, but simply set up some outer marks, I have substituted the description expounded in the context Mr. Anandoram Borooah has preceded me in this way.</p>
    <p>Moreover I have tested Panini’s rule in numerous instances, but found it deficient now and then even when paying due respect to the modifications made in it by the different vârttikas on our sûtras (1, 4, 52 sq.), whereas the same enquiry confirmed the exactness of the rule as it has been laid down in the context.</p>
