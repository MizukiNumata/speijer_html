    <p>491. Direct construction.</p>
    <p>A special kind of subordination is the so called indirect construction, representing words uttered or reflections made by another, not in the shape they originally did bear, but transformed according to the speaker’s point of view. This mode of quoting speech or thought of another, although it is not wholly unknown in Sanskrit, is not idiomatic. As a rule the Sanskrit speaker avails himself of the <b>direct construction</span>, that is, he does not change the outward form of the words and ideas quoted, but he reproduces them unaltered, just as they came from the mouth or arose in the mind of their authors. Instead of saying, as we do, <i>you have said you would come</span>, one says rather in this way <i>I will come, so you have said</span> <skt>AgamiSyAmIty avAdId bhavAn}.</p>
    <p>It is but one idiom, the <i>accusative with participle</span>, that can be set apart for the indirect construction, see 374. As to the subordinate sentences, introduced by <skt>yat}, <skt>yathA}, <skt>yena} or <skt>yataH} =»that,’’ <skt>yadi} = »if’’ (481), in a great many cases here will be no formal difference whatever between the direct and the indirect construction, owing among others to the faculty of expressing the predicate by a noun; where there may be such a difference, the direct construction is, as a rule, employed, cp. 494.</p>
