    <p>492. iti.</p>
    <p>The direct construction is characterized by the particle <skt>iti} generally added to the words or the thought quoted: <skt>AgamiSyAmIty avAdIH} (you have said you would come), <skt>na mAM kazcitpazyatIti cintayati} (he thinks nobody sees him).</p>
    <p><skt>iti} is properly a demonstrative adverb, meaning »thus, so, in this manner’’ (*1) and for this reason a synonym to <skt>ittham}, <skt>evam}. Ṛgv. 10, 119, 1 <skt>ii vA iti me mano gAmazvaM sanuyAm iti} (so indeed, so is my thought, that I may obtain kine and horses); Ratn. III, p. 70 the parting sun taking his leave from the white lotus is represented by the simile of a lover, who goes away from his beloved, to come back the next morning <skt>yAto ‘smi padmavadane samayo mamaiSa suptA mayaiva bhavatI pratibodhanIyA / pratyAyanAmayamitIva saroruhiNyAH} (I go, lily-face, it is my time, [yet] it is I who will awake you out of sleep, in almost this way the sinking sun comforts the waterlily). But as <skt>iti} is almost exclusively employed for quoting one’s thought or the utterance thereof (*2), it is often not to be rendered at all. Moreover we often use the indirect construction. Nala. 3, 1 <skt>tebhyaH pratijJAya nalaH kariSya iti} (Nala promised them, he would do so —). Sometimes <skt>iti} abounds even in Sanskrit, the pleonasm <skt>ityevam} and the like being allowed, cp. 496 R.</p>

    <p>I recollect but one instance of <skt>iti} = »so, thus,’’ used as a pure demonstrative, viz. Panc. 327 <skt>vAnaro ‘pi tiSThati yathA bhavAn iti} (the monkey stood, just as you do). Note also the employment or <skt>iti} at the close or literary compositions, f. i. <skt>iti zAkuntale prathamo ‘GkaH} (here ends the first act of t.he Çâkuntala), just as <skt>atha} is used in tho beginning.</p>
