    <p>As a rule, in prose <skt>iti} is put immediately after the direct construction. But sometimes an other arrangement is preferred, especially in poets and for metrical reasons. So in epic poetry such phrases as <skt>ityuvAca}, <skt>ityuktaH} sometimes precede the words quoted, sometimes they follow after them. F. i. R. 1, 47, 8 the line <skt>uvAca prAJcalirvAkyamitIdaM balasUdanaH} precedes the very words quoted, Daç. 191 the sentence <skt>dizi dizItyakIrtye janena} »in all regions this was told of me’’ precedes, the contents of the rumour follow. Cp. Kumâras. 4, 27 <skt>iti cainam [sc. vasantam] uvAca duHkhitA / suhRdaH pazya vasanta kiM sthitam}, etc. — On the other hand, R. 1, 27, 26 it bas been said first what was spoken to Râma, then follows who said so. Nor is it rare to put <skt>iti} in the midst of the words quoted. Panc. III, 160 in <skt>mA cAsmai tvaM kRthA dveSaM baddhAneneti matpriyA} = <skt>anena matpriyAM} »be not moved with anger towards him [while thinking]: it is be, who caught my sweetheart.’’ R. 1, 55, 11 <skt>sa putramekaM rAjyAya pAlayeti niyujya ca / pRthivIM kSatradharmeNa vanamevAbhyapadyata}, here the direct construction is <skt>pAlaya pRthivIM kSatradharmeNa}.</p>
