    <p>497. Elliptical construction.</p>
    <p>It is of frequent occurrence that the verb of <i>speaking</span>, <i>knowing</span>, <i>thinking</span>, <i>deliberating</span> etc. is not expressed, but <skt>iti} alone is the exponent of the direct construction. In this case, <skt>iti} is of great importance for the sense, and its translation is various, according to the relation which exists between the main action and the contents of the direct construction inserted. For instance, if it happens that some motive is denoted by it, then <skt>iti} may be translated by <i>because</span>, <i>since</span> or by <i>therefore</span>, <i>for this reason</span>. Another time the direct construction may be expressive of something to be done, then <skt>iti} requires being rendered by <i>in order that</span>, sim. Sometimes again this somewhat elliptical idiom serves only to enhance the vividness of the style.</p>
    <p>In full, one says also <skt>iti kṛtvā} (lit. „thus doing’’) = „thus thinking, considering, reflecting.’’</p>
    <p>Examples: R. 1, 55, 11 <skt>sa putram ekaṃ rājyāya pālayeti niyujya ca / pṛthivīṃ kṣatradharmeṇa vanam evābhyapadyata}, here <skt>iti niyujya} = »with these words he appointed him’’. — Mrcch. I, p. 38 Cârudatta apostrophizes Poverty <skt>dāridyra śocāmi bhavantam evam asmac charīre suhṛdity uṣitvā} (»in this way I mourn, Poverty, for thee, who bast dwelled with me as a friend’’, lit. considering me your friend). — Mudr. III, p. 126 <skt>cāṇakyataḥ skha[= ca?]litabhaktim ahaṃ sukhena jeṣyāmi mauryam iti saṃprati yaḥ prayuktaḥ / bhedaḥ kilaiṣa bhavatā} (the dissension you have plotted, thinking you would easily vanquish Candragupta, if his faith in Câṇakya should be shaken). Mhbh. 1, 153, 42 <skt>punar bhīmo balād enaṃ vicakarṣa mahābalaḥ / mā śabdaḥ sukhasuptānāṃ bhrātṝṇāṃ me bhaved iti} (again, the strong Bhîma shook him [but in such a way], that no noise might awake his brothers who slept quietly), R. 3, 10, 3 <skt>kṣatriyair dhāryate cāpo nārtaśabdo bhaved iti} (the warriors carry their bows in order to rescue the distressed), R. 2, 52, 28 <skt>na cāham anuśocāmi lakṣmaṇo na ca śocati / ayodhyāyāś cyutāś ceti vane vatsyāmaheti vā} (neither I nor Laxmaṇa mourns for our having been expulsed from Ayodhyâ or for having to dwell in the forest), Mrcch. I, p. 19 <skt>gṛham asmadīyaṃ kṣīṇārtham ity athitayaḥ parivarjayanti} (guests shun my dwelling, because wealth has vanished from it), Pat. I, p. 99 <skt>na hi bhikṣukāḥ santīti sthālyo nādhiśrīyante na ca mṛgāḥ santīti yavā nopyante} (we do not abstain from cooking, considering there are beggars, nor do we abstain from sowing, considering there are antelopes), Utt. I, p. 2 <skt>vaideśiko ‘smīti pṛcchāmi} (as I am a stranger to this country, I question [you]), Mâlav. I, p. 3 <skt>purāṇam ity eva na sādhu sarvaṃ na cāpi kāvyaṃ navam ity avadyam} (not every old poem is to be approved only for its age, nor is new poetry to be blamed only because it is new); — Çâk. II <skt>darbhāṅkureṇa caraṇaḥ kṣata ity akāṇḍe tanvī sthitā katicid eva padāni gatvā} (when she had gone some steps, she stopped on a sudden feigning her foot was hurt by a blade of grass), Kathâs. 62, 49 <skt>nīḍo me tava nety evaṃ vivāda udabhūd dvayoḥ} (a quarrel arose between them on account of the nest, lit. »[both of them saying] the nest is mine, not yours’’), and compare the altercation, which is found in the opening stanza of the Mudrârâxasa, and is intended to display the cunning of Çiva:</p>
    <p><skt>dhanyā keyaṃ sthitā te śirasi śaśikalā kiṃ nu nāmaitad asyāḥ nāmaivāsyās tad etat paricitam api te vismṛtaṃ kasya hetoḥ / nārīṃ pṛcchāmi nenduṃ kathayatu vijayā na pramāṇaṃ yadīndur devyā nihnotum icchor iti surasaritaṃ śāṭhyam avyād vibhor vaḥ}</p>
    <p>the last pâda signifies: »may the craft of the Lord protect you, [who] desirous of concealing Gangâ from Devî, his wife, [acted] thus,’’ how he acted is set forth in pâda 1-3, containing the questions of Umâ and the answers of Çiva.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Among the most common applications of this freer construction, note <skt>tatheti} express consent, lit. »[saying] yes,’’ <skt>kim iti} »why?’’ lit. »[asking] what?’’ — Comments and glosses are marked by <skt>iti} (<skt>iti yāvat}, <skt>iti bhāvaḥ} etc.), quotations by <skt>iti} with the name of the author or his work. Objections, which may be made, are represented by <skt>iti cet} — in full <skt>iti cedbhavet} —, f. i. Sây. on Ait. Br. 1, 20, 3 <skt>nābhiśabdavācyatvaṃ katham iti cet / tad ucyate} (now, as one might ask why it [the navel] is denoted by, the word <i>nâbhi</span>, etc.) And so on.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. <skt>iti} is also used when imitating sounds, as <skt>paṭiti karoti}. {cp. P. 6, 1, 98.} Nala. 2, 4 <skt>na naktaṃ na divā śete hā heti rudatī punaḥ}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. Pâṇini teaches: The 2d person sing. of the imperative put twice with <skt>iti} may be added to the narrative tense of the same verb, in order to denote the action being done with intensity or repeatedly <skt>lunīhi lunīhīty ayaṃ lunāti / lunīhi lunīhītīme lunanti}. {P. 3, 4, 2-5.} Likewise this singular number of the imper. repeated may express the performing of several actions at the same time. Kâç. exemplifies it by this instance <skt>bhrāṣṭramaṭa maṭhamaṭa khadūramaṭa sthālyapidhānam aṭety eva tvam aṭasi / yuvām aṭathaḥ / yūyam aṭatha}, to represent the hurry and bustle of people occupied in the kitchen. Instead of the same verb put twice, also synonyms may be used. Çiçup. I, 51 <skt>purīmavaskanda lunīhi nandanaṃ muṣāṇa ratnāni harāmarāṅganāḥ / vigṛhya cakre namucadviṣā balī ya ittham asvāsthyamahardivaṃ divaḥ}.</p>
    <p>For the rest, it is not the repetition of imperatives alone, that serves to bring forward the idea of tumultuary action. In such cases as Panc. 62 <skt>atha te tatra viśvāsam āpnnās tāta mātula bhrātar iti bruvāṇā ahaṃ pūrvam ahaṃ pūrvam iti samantāt paritasthuḥ}, the repeated words <skt>ahaṃ pūrvam} serve the same purpose. And so often.</p>
