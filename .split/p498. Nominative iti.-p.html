    <p>498. Nominative iti.</p>
    <p>Since <skt>iti} quotes or pretends to quote speech or thought, the direct construction, which is distinguished by it from the main framework of the context, is a sentence or a complex of sentences, not a mere complex of words. Yet, these sentences are not always given in full, they are sometimes elliptical and may even consist of one single word. When a noun, this is of course a <b>nominative</span>. So f. i. Nala. 16, 8 <skt>tAM… tarkayAmAsa bhaimIti} (her she guessed to be the daughter of Bhîma, lit. she guessed [thinking: „she is] the daughter of Bhîma’’). There is a predilection for using such a nominative with <skt>iti}, in order to express the predicate of the object of verbs of <i>calling</span>, <i>styling</span>, <i>considering</span>, <i>holding for</span> and the like (32, <i>c</span>).
