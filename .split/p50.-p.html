    <p>In the passive construction these two types are likewise possible: 1. <i>the primitive’s subject turns nominative</span>, <i>the primitive’s object remains accusative</span>, as Mudr. V, p.172 <skt>paridhāpitā vayam ābharaṇaṃ kumāreṇa}, the active form of which would be <skt>kumāra asmān ābharaṇaṃ paridhāpitavān}, 2. <i>the primitive’s subject is instrumental</span>, <i>but the primitive’s object turns nominative</span>, as Mudr. I, p. 22 <skt>viṣakanyayā rākṣasena ghātitas tapasvī parvateśvaraḥ} active <skt>viṣakanyayā rākṣaso ghātitavān tapasvinaṃ parvatevaram} (R. has killed the unhappy Parv. by means of a <i>vishakanyâ</span>). The latter type appears to be rare(*1), the former is the general one and is applied even in such cases, as would not admit of two accusatives in the active form.</p>
    <p>Examples of type 1. — Mudr. VII, p.222 <skt>śakaṭadās astapasvī taṃ kapaṭalekhaṃ mayaiva lekhitaḥ}, Kull. on M. 8, 287 <skt>yāvān vyayo bhavati tam asau dāpanīyaḥ} (he must be caused to pay as much as has been expended), Daç. 164 <skt>ahañ ca kośadāsena snānabhojanādikam anubhāvito ‘smi} (Koçadâsa made me enjoy a bath, food etc.), Hitop. 96 <skt>tatastena [sc. śaśena] sa yūthapatiḥ praṇāmaṃ kāritaḥ} (then he [the hare] commanded the chief elephant to make his prostration), R. 2, 62, l <skt>rājā rāmamātrā śrāvitaḥ paruṣaṃ vākyam}.</p>
    <p>Example of type 2. Mâlav. I, p.15 <skt>atha āvaśyam eva mādhavaseno mayā pūjyena mocayitavyaḥ} (v. a. His Majesty, indeed, has it in his own power to make me release Madhayasena).</p>

    <p>Apart from the two examples adduced in the context I do not remember having met with any. In both of them the object and the agent are persons.</p>
