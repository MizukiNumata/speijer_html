    <p>Some verbal forms as <skt>manye} (I think), <skt>jAne} (I know, I think), <skt>zaGke} (I guess), <skt>AzaMse} (I trust), <skt>pazya} (look) often have no influence at all on the sentence even when put in the midst. Likewise such phrases as <skt>na saMzayaH}, <skt>nAtra saMzayaH} v. a. ,,undoubtedly, no doubt.’’</p>
    <p>Kathâs. 25, 166 <skt>suptA jAne striyA svapne kayApyuktAsmi divyayA} (a heavenly woman, methinks, spoke to me, when asleep), Nâgân. II, p. 35 <skt>kusumamapi vicetuM yo na manye samarthaH / kalayati sa kathaM te pAzamudbandhanAya} (this [hand) of yours, which hardly I think would gather even a flower, how can it, serve to put a halter round your neck?), R. 2, 84, 18 <skt>AzaMse svAzitA senA vatsyatyenAM vibhAvarIm} (I trust the army being well supplied with food, will stay [with me] for the night), Çâk. VI <skt>zaGke saMharati smaro ‘pi cakitastUNArdhakRSTaM zaram} (even Kâma, I believe, draws back his arrow), Kathâs. 26, 13 <skt>brahmanvinAzakAlo ‘yaM ghruvamasmAkamAgataH / yadakasmAtpravahaNaM pazyAtraiva prayAtyadhaH}, Panc. 48 the wife of the barber cries <skt>pApenAnena mama sadAcAravartinyAH pazyata nAsikAchedo vihitaH}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. <skt>manye}, <skt>jAne} and the like not seldom express irony, in which case may be applied what is taught by Pâṇini (1, 4, 106 and 8, 1, 46) about <skt>ehi manye} with the 2d person of the future <skt>ehi manya odanaM bhokSyase} »now, indeed, you will eat rice,’’ if the meaning of the speaker is: »you think you will, but it cannot be, there is no rice to be eaten. (*1)’’)</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>The explication of Pâṇini, <skt>manye} is used <i>instead of</span> <skt>manyase}. cannot be accepted. The idea »you think falsely’’ is not purported by <skt>manye}, but it is implied by the ironical form of utterance. In sentences of the kind <skt>manye} has almost got the character of a particle.</p>
