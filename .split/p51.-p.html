    <p>When having got a more or less figurative sense, the causatives may change their construction. So with <skt>darśayati} (to show) and <skt>śrāvayati} (to tell) the person who is caused to see and to hear is sometimes put in the acc. as attending on a causative, but it is more common to use the gen. or dat., because they in fact range with the verbs of <i>showing</span> and <i>telling</span>. So <skt>vedayati} and its compounds are never construed with the acc. of the person to whom something is made known.</p>
