    <p>52. Accusative depending on nouns.</p>
    <p>The accusative of the object is not restricted to the finite verbs, but affects also some active verbal forms, which are grammatically classed among the nouns. In the first place all participles, gerunds and infinitives with active signification must have their object put in the accusative. Hitherto there is no difference between the syntax of Sanskrit and of its sister-languages. But the accusative is also wanted with some classes of verbal nouns, commonly not reckoned among the participles etc.(*1), nl. <i>a.</span>) with those in <skt>u}, made of desiderative verbs; this class of adjectives has indeed almost the nature of participles, <i>b.</span>) with some in of <skt>iṣṇu} kindred signification, <i>c.</span>) with those in <skt>aka}, when having the worth of a partic. of the future, <i>d.</span>) with some krts in <skt>-in}(*2), <i>e.</span>) with the krts in <skt>-tṛ}, when barytona. {P. 2, 3, 69 sq.}</p>
    <p>Examples: <i>a.</span>) M. 1, 8 <skt>sisṛkṣur vividhāḥ prajāḥ} (wishing to create the manifold creatures), Mhbh. 1, 167, 48 <skt>sarvayoṣi dvarā kṛṣṇā ninīṣuḥ kṣatriyān kṣayam}; — <i>b.</span>) Daç. 25 <skt>teṣāṃ bhāṣaṇapāruṣyam asahiṣṇur aham} (as I could not bear the harshness of their words); — <i>c.</span>) Kâç. on P. 2, 3, 70 <skt>kaṭaṃ kārako vrajati} (he goes to make a mat)(*3); <i>e.</span>) see 53.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Those in <skt>uka} are also mentioned by Pâṇini as agreeing with acc., but this construction has antiquated. Instances of it are met with in the archaic dialect, Taitt. S. 6, 1, 6, 6 <skt>kāmukā enaṃ striyo bhavanti ya evaṃ veda}, Ch. Up. 5, 2, 2 <skt>lambhuko ha vāso bhavati} (surely, he obtains a dress).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Note also the acc. with the adj. <skt>arha} (worth, deserving). As far as I know, this idiom is restricted to the epics. Mhbh. 1, 63, 4 <skt>indratvam arho rājāyaṃ tapasā} (this king is by his penance worth of Indra’s rank), R. 1 , 53, 12 <skt>na parityāgamarheyaṃ matsakāśāt} (she is not worth being given up by me)(*4).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. In the ancient dialect of the vaidik mantras many more kinds of verbal nouns may agree with acc. So for inst. Rgv. 6, 23, 4 <skt>babhrir vajraṃ papiḥ somaṃ dadirgāḥ}. Mhbh. 1, 113, 21 we have even an acc. depending on a nomen actionis <skt>jigīṣayā mahīṃ pāṇḍur nirakrāmat purāt} (by his desire to conquer the earth…) ; likewise ibid. 1, 167, 3 <skt>droṇaṃ praticikīrṣayā} (by his wish to retaliate Droṇa).</p>

    <p>Especially, if a debt be the object, P. 2, 3, 70. Kâç. <skt>śataṃ dāyī}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>Examples in literature are scarce. Whitney (Grammar § 271 <i>c.</span>) quotes Mhbh. 3, 73, 25 <skt>bhavantam abhivādakaḥ}, but the example is doubtful, for the whole sentence runs thus: <skt>āgato ‘smi bhavantam abhivādakaḥ}, where it is also possible to accept the acc. as the aim of the verb <skt>āgataḥ}. — R. 3, 10, 15 <skt>tadardyamānān rakṣābhir daṇḍakāraṇyavāsibhiḥ / rakṣakas tvaṃ} would afford an instance of <skt>rakṣaka}, construed with the accusative, if it were not probably a bad reading; <skt>rakṣakas tvaṃ} is to be changed in <skt>rakṣa nas tvam}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*4)</p>
    <p>In the classical language <skt>arha} complies with genitive. So Priyad. 39 <skt>upaviśatv arheyam ardhāsanasya} (let her sit down, she is worth half of my seat). Likewise <skt>anarha}.</p>
