    <p>The acc. with the barytona in <skt>-tṛ} though not rare in the earlier period, seems to protract but an artificial life in classic Sanskrit, as it is met with only in refined style and even there side by side with the genitive(*1). Daç. 199 it is said of a good king, that he was <skt>saṃbhāvayitā budān prabhāvayitā sevakān udbhāvatitā bandhūn nyagbhāvayitā śatrūn} (honouring the wide, making his attendants mighty, raising his kinsmen, lowering his foes); comp. Panc. III, 71 <skt>narapatir netā prajāḥ} (a king, who rules his subjects). — On the other hand, the examples given by Kaç. on P. 3, 2, 135 prove that at the time, they were applied at first, the construction with the acc. was obvious and natural. So <skt>muṇḍapitāraḥ śrāviṣṭḥāyanā bhavanti vadhūmūṭām} (the ÇrâvishThâyanas have the custom to shave the hair of the young-married woman.) Cp. Âpast. 1, 3, 15.</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Pâṇini explicitly states (P. 3, 2, 134 sq.), that the barytona in <skt>-tṛ} are restricted to the denoting of lasting and inherent qualities. But he nowhere affirms that the oxytona are not to be employed in that sense. Indeed, a genitive with nouns in [-tR], even when expressing lasting qualities, is very common in classic Sanskrit. In the same passage Daç. 199, the example in the context has been borrowed from, we read <skt>parīkṣitā sarvadhyakṣāṇām} and <skt>sadhyaḥ pratikartā daivamānuṣīṇāmāpadām…manumārgeṇa praṇetā cāturvaparyasya}. Comp. the list of epithets in Kâd. I, p.2 <skt>kartā mahāśraryāṇām} etc.</p>
