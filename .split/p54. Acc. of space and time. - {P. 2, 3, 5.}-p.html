    <p>54. Acc. of space and time. / {P. 2, 3, 5.}</p>
    <p>III. The <b>accusative of space or time</span> serves to denote a continuity of either; it expresses therefore <i>what space is occupied</span> or <i>during what time</span> the action is going on. Compare the acc. <i>spatii</span> and <i>temporis</span> in Latin, Greek, German etc.</p>
    <p>Examples: <i>a.</span>) space R. 2, 91, 29 <skt>babhūva hi samā bhūmiḥ samantāt pañcayojanam} (for the soil became flat over an extent of five yojana’s in every direction), Mhbh. 1, 153, 40 <skt>nigṛhya taṃ…cakarṣa ha tasmād deśād dhanṛṃṣ yaṣṭau} (he seized him and dragged him along over a space of eight bow-lengths).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. When naming the dimensions of a thing, one does not use this accus., but avails one’s self of bahuvrîhi-compounds.</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) time Panc. 165 <skt>etāvanti dināni tvadīyam āsīt} (for so many days it was yours), Daç. 96 <skt>bhadrakāḥ pratīkṣyatāṃ kañcit kālam} (gentle sirs, please, wait a moment).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Now and then the acc. of time denotes <i>the time at which</span>. R. 2, 69, 1 <skt>yām eva rātriṃ te dūtāḥ praviśanti sma tāṃ purīm / bharatenāpi tāṃ rātrim svapno dṛṣṭo ‘yam apriyaḥ}, Daç. 153 <skt>so ‘pi viṭaḥ…tadahareva svagṛhe snānabhojanādi kārayet vottaredhyuḥ}. Cp. Ait. Br. 1, 22, 12; Mhbh. 1, 63, 40; ibid. 1, 121, 34; Âpast. 1, 5, 12.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Sometimes <skt>yāvat} is put behind the acc., when denoting the time, <i>during which</span>. Hitop. p. 51 <skt>mayā māsam ekaṃ yāvad gaurīvrataṃ kartavyam} (I am bound to perform during a month a vow for Durgâ).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. The acc. of time remains unchanged in the passive; see Daç. 96 quoted above. But occasionally it is dealt with, as if it were the object. R. 2, 88, 2 <skt>iha tasya mahātmanaḥ śarvarī śayitā bhūmau} (= here the noble hero has passed the night on the naked earth) instead of <skt>śarvarīṃ śayitam}(*1).</p>

    <p>Comp. such Latin expressions, as Caes. B. G. 5, 89, 4 <i>aegre is dies sustentatur</span>, and the interesting discussion on the matter Pat. I, p.445 sq. From Patañjali’s words it is sufficiently plain, that to say <skt>āsyate māsaḥ / śayyate krośaḥ} is as good as <skt>āsyate māsam / śayyate krośam}. From another passage of the same book (I, p.338, vârtt. 9) it results, that some made the kâlakarma-verbs range with the <i>akarmaka</span> or intransitives.</p>
