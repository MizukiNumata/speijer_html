    <p>58. Instrumental, when sociative.</p>
    <p>I. <<b>>Sociative</span>. — The instrumental is the equivalent of our <i>with</span> = <i>together with</span>, <i>accompanied by</span>. In this manner the third case is used f. i. Panc. I, 305 <skt>mṛgā mṛgaiḥ saṅgam anuvrajanti gāvaś ca gobhis turagās turaṅgaiḥ / mūrkhāś ca sudhiyaḥ sudhīmiḥ} (deer seek after the comradeship with deer, so kine with kine and horse with horse, the fool with the fool and the wise with the wise).</p>

    <p><i>a.</span>) with prepositions.</p>
    <p>Upon the whole however, the instrumental, when sociative, is accompanied by some word expressive of the notion of <i>being together</span> viz. 1° the adverbs <skt>saha}, <skt>samam}, <skt>sārdham}, <skt>sākam} which may then be considered prepositions, as <skt>rāmaḥ sotayā saha}; 2° such participles as <skt>sahita}, <skt>saṅgata}, <skt>yukta}, <skt>anvita} and the like, as <skt>rāmaḥ sītayā sahitaḥ} or compounded <skt>sītāsahitaḥ}. Or the notion of the sociative is expressed by a compound, the former part of which is <skt>sa-} (or <skt>saha-}) as <skt>rāmaḥ sasītaḥ}. Occasionally the gerund <skt>ādāya} (having taken) is also used in the meaning of <i>with</span>.</p>
    <p>The prepositional adverbs etc. are likewise added to the instrumental for the sake of denoting relations between different parties as <i>to converse with, to meddle with, to fight with, to contend with</span>, sim.</p>
    <p>Examples: <i>a.</span>) <skt>saha} etc. expressive</p>
    <p>1. of concomitancy. Mrcch. X, p.372 <skt>api dhriyate cārudattaḥ saha vasantasenayā} (are Cârudatta and Vasantasenâ still alive?), Mhbh. 1, 113, 20 <skt>sa tābhyāṃ vyacarat sārdhaṃ bhāryābhyāṃ rājasattamaḥ / kuntyā mādyrā ca rājendraḥ}, Panc. 127 <skt>tena samam eva svadeśaṃ prati prasthitāḥ}, Kathâs. 4, 136 <skt>ahaṃ jananyā gurubhiś ca sākam…avasam};</p>
    <p>2. of mutual relations. Panc. 78 <skt>taiḥ sahālāpaṃ na karoti}; ibid. 257 <skt>kas tena saha tava snehaḥ}: (v. a. how are you his friend?), ibid. 281 <skt>mitreṇa saha cittaviśleṣaḥ} (disagreement with a friend), Kathâs. 47, 88 <skt>sa tena vidadhe samaṃ yuddham} (he fought with him), Panc. V, 66 <skt>cāraṇair vandibhir nīcair nāpi tair bālakair api / na mantraṃ matimān kuryāt sārdham}. Note the phrase <skt>tena saha darśanam} (Panc. 137, 13; 178, 1) and the type, represented Panc. 43 <skt>tāṃ sthūṇayā saha dṛḍhabandhanena baddhvā} (after having fastened her to the pile with a strong fetter).</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) <skt>sahita} and the like: Kathâs. 13, 110 <skt>svagṛhaṃ bhṛtyasahitaḥ palāyyaiva tato yayau} (he fled from this spot to his home with his attendance), R. 2, 32, 91 Sîtâ prays <skt>punar eva mahābāhur mayā bhrātrā ca saṃgataḥ [that is: <i>with</span> his brother and me] ayodhyāṃ vanavāsāt praviśatu}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. An elegant paraphrase of the sociative is occasionally <skt>-dvitīya} used as the latter part of a bahuvrîhi. So in the verse quoted Pat. I, p.426 <skt>asidvitīyo ‘nusasāra pāṇḍavam} = »alone but for his good sword, he went after the Pâṇḍava,&quot; Daç. 159 <skt>ekānte bhavān utkaṇṭhita iva parivādinīdvitīyas tiṣṭhati} (you stand aside as if longing for some you love, alone with your lute), Panc. 159 <skt>rājakanyā sakhīdvitīyā}.</p>
