    <p>Compound nouns or verbs, whose former part is <skt>saṃ}, <skt>sa} or <skt>saha}, 2ly many words expressive of the notions of <i>uniting, combining, mingling</span> are often construed with the sole instrumental, even in prose. This construction is the regular one with <skt>yuj} and its derivates.</p>
    <p>Examples: <i>a.</span>) compounds, commencing by <skt>saṃ} etc. Daç. 79 <skt>akṣadhūrtaiḥ samagaṃsi}, Hitop. p.16 <skt>yasya mitreṇa saṃlāpas tato nāstīha puṇyavān} (there is not in this world a man more happy, than he, who has a friend to converse with), Çâk. IV, vs. 12 <skt>cūtena saṃśritavatī navamālikā} (a jasmine, clinging to a mango-tree). Mrcch. I, p.34 <skt>ratnaṃ ratnena saṃgacchate}.</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) other verbs of uniting, mingling, combining. — M. 1, 26 <skt>dvandvair ayojayaccemāḥ sukhaduḥkhādibhiḥ prajāḥ}, Panc. 274 <skt>so ‘pi svajātyā militaḥ} (mixed with his kinsmen), Çâk. I, vs. 30 <skt>vācaṃ na miśrayati madvacobhiḥ} (she does not join her voice to mine).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. <skt>yojayati} is often = Lat. <i>afficere alqum alqua re</span>. So Mhbh. I (Paushyap.) <skt>śiṣyān kleśena yojayituṃ neyeṣa} (it was not his intention to harass his pupils), cp. R. 2, 75, 57. Many times it is = »to bestow something upon somebody&quot;, f.i. Panc. 3 <skt>ahaṃ tvāṃ śāsanaśatena yojayiṣyāmi} (I will bestow a hundred of grants upon you).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. P. 2, 3, 22 mentions the verb <skt>saṃjñā}, complying with acc. or instrum., but instances of that idiom seem to be wanting in literature; Patañjali gives the example <skt>pitaraṃ} or <skt>pitrā saṃjānīte}, but it is not plain what is here the meaning of <skt>saṃjñā}. — A similar instrum. depending on a compound verb, commencing by <skt>saṃ}, is taught by Pân. 1, 3, 55 and his commentators, see Pat. I, p. 284. According to them it is said <skt>dāsyā saṃprayacchate / vṛṣalyā saṃprayacchate} »he makes presents to a servant-maid, to a female of low-caste, etc.” the instr. being used only in the case of illicit intercourse.</p>
