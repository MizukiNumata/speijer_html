    <p>61. Instrum. or genitive with adjj. of <i>likeness</span>, <i>equality</span>, etc.</p>
    <p>The instrumetal attends on the adjectives of <i>equality, likeness, identity</span> and the like, as <skt>sama}, <skt>samāna}, <skt>sadṛśa}, <skt>tulya}. {P. 2, 3, 72} Here however the genitive is a concurrent construction, just as in Latin. It is said promiscuously <skt>pituḥ} or <skt>pitrā samaḥ putraḥ}.</p>
    <p>Examples: R. 2, 118, 35 <skt>śakreṇa samaḥ} (equal to Indra), Hit. I, 22 <skt>paśubhiḥ samānāḥ} (like beasts), Hit. p.118 <skt>anena sadṛśo loke na bhūto na bhaviṣyati}, Mâlav. I, p.21 <skt>ayaṃ na me pādarajasāpi tulyaḥ} (he is not even equal to the dust of my feet); Pat. I, p.327 <skt>taiḥ sāmyaṃ gatavān bhavati} (he has become their equal). — If »to compare with” is to be expressed by some metaphor, the instrumental will often be of use, so for ex., when it is denoted by the image of putting on a balance, cp. Kumâras. 5, 34. — Compare also such expressions as Daç. 130 <skt>sā ‘ham apy ebhir eva suhṛḍir ekakarmaḥ} (and I having the same business as these friends of mine here).</p>
    <p>of a genitive: Mhbh. 1, 139, 16 <skt>arjunasya samo loke nāsti kaścid dhanurdharaḥ}, R. 2, 23, 3 <skt>babhau kruddhasya siṃhasya mukhasya sadṛśaṃ mukhamaḥ} ([his] face shone like the face of an angry lion).</p>
