    <p>62. Instrumental with words of <i>separation</span>.</p>
    <p>As the instrumental is the exponent of the notion of <i>accompaniment</span> and <i>simultaneousness</span>, so it is also available with words expressive of the very contrary, namely <i>separation</span> and <i>disjunction</span>. In the same way as it is said <skt>tvayā sahitaḥ}, <skt>tvayā yuktaḥ} „with you,” one is allowed to say <skt>tvayā rahitaḥ}, <skt>tvayā viyuktaḥ} „without you.”(*1) The proper case for expressing separation, the ablative is however also available. In some phrases the instrumental is more frequently employed, in other again the ablative. The instrum. prevails with <skt>viyuj} and most of the compounds, beginning with <skt>vi-}, also with <skt>rahita} and <skt>hīna}, but the ablative with such as <skt>muc}, <skt>bhraś}.</p>
    <p>Examples: Panc. 84 <skt>prāṇair na viyuktaḥ} (he was not deprited of life), Daç. 172 <skt>tuṣair akhaṇḍais taṇḍulān pṛthakcakāra} (she peeled the grains of rice of their husks, so [cleverly] as to keep them entire), Kathâs. 15, 82 <skt>sītādevyā rāmo viṣehe virahavyathām} (R. forbore the grief caused by his separation from Sîtâ), R. 2, 96, 27 <skt>kaluṣeṇa mahatā medinī parimucyatām} (let the earth be freed from a great stain). (*2)</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The adjectives <skt>rahita}, <skt>hīna}, <skt>vihīna}, <skt>viyukta} sim. often are = »without.”</p>

    <p>Delbr. 1. 1. p.71 »Der begriff <i>trennung</span> ist zwar logisch der gegensatz von zusammensein, liegt ihm aber desshalb psychologisch sehr nahe.” Or, to speak more exactly, it is not the conception of separation, that is expressed or signified by the instrumental, but the notion of <i>mutuality</span> underlying both union and separation, finds in it its adequate expression. We have here therefore the same kind of instrum., which is spoken of in 59, <i>b</span> 2. Accordingly words of separation may also be construed with <skt>saha} etc. Panc. 57 <skt>mamānayā saha viyogo bhaviṣyati}. Compare English <i>to part with</span>.</p>

    <p>M. 2, 79 affords an instance of instrum. and abl. depending on the same verb. The latter half-çloka runs thus <skt>mahatopy enaso māsāt tvacevāhir vimucyate} (after a month he is released even from a great sin likewise as a snake from its skin). Here the abl. <skt>enasaḥ} and the instr. <skt>tvacā} are coordinate. Compare the like coincidence of <i>abl.</span> and <i>instr.</span> <i>causae.</span></p>
