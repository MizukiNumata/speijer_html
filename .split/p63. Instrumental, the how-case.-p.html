    <p>63. Instrumental, the how-case.</p>
    <p>II. By extending the notions of concomitancy, accompaniment, simultaneousness from space and time to all sorts of logical categories, we may understand how large a sphere of employment the third case occupies in Sanskrit syntax. Generally spoken, it is always used, when it is wanted to express the circumstances, instruments, means, ways, properties accompanying the action and qualifying it. In other terms, the instrumental has the duty of telling the <i>how</span> of the action or state, expressed by the verb or verbal noun, it depends on.</p>
    <p>For clearness’ sake the most striking types of this instrumental will be severally enumerated: 1ly and 2ly it is expressive of the instrument (karaṇa) and the agent (kartṛ). These two kinds of instrumental are practically the most important, for they are the most wanted for. Examples of the former <skt>dātreṇa lunāti} (he cuts with a knife), <skt>padbhyāṃ gacchati} (he goes on foot); of the latter <skt>mayā tatkṛtam} (it is done by me) (57).</p>
    <p><i>Thirdly</span>, the instrum. denotes <i>accompanying circumstances</span> and <i>qualities</span>, like Latin abl. modi and qualitatis. M. 4, 3 <skt>akleśena śarīrasya karvīta dhanasaṃcayam} (he must make money, but without giving toil to his body), Panc. 129 <skt>damanakasācivyena piṅgalako rājyam akarot} (Ping. exercised his royalty with Dam. as his minister).</p>
    <p><i>Fourthly</span>, it declares the test, to measure by; <skt>phalenaitaj jñāsyasi} (you will know it by its fruit).</p>
    <p><i>Fifthly</span>, it expresses the price or value, something is rated at, bought, sold, hired for, the thing, some other is taken for in exchange, sim. Panc. 158 <skt>rūpakaśatena vikrīyamāṇaḥ pustakaḥ} (a book sold for a hundred rupees).</p>
    <p><i>Sixthly</span>, it denotes the way, by which one goes; Çâk. III <skt>anayā bālapādapavīthyā sutanur aciraṃ gatā} (the tender girl has passed a little before along this row of young trees).</p>
    <p><i>Seventhly</span>, the instrumental denotes the <i>cause</span>, <i>motive</span> or <i>reason</span>, by which something is done or happens to be; <skt>dhanena kuśalaḥ} (prosperous by wealth), <skt>vidyayā yaśaḥ} (fame by learning), <skt>madājñayāgato ‘sau} (that person has arrived by my order), <skt>prītyā dānam} (v. a. a present).</p>
