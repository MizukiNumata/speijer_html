    <p>It should be kept in mind, however, that these and similar distinctions are but made for argument’s sake and do not answer to sharply separated real divisions. Properly speaking, there is but one instrumental in all of them, just as in English it is the same word <i>with</span>, which is used in phrases as distant from one another as <i>I go with you</span>, <i>I cut with a knife</span>, <i>he with his black hat</span>, <i>he is content with me</span>. For this reason on the one hand nothing impedes increasing the number of divisions and subdivisions according to the manifold logical variety of its employment, but on the other hand no system of division will exhaust it, and more than once we may be at a loss under which head to enregister a given instrumental.</p>
