    <p>67. 3. Quality etc.</p>
    <p>3. quality, attribute, circumstance(*1). {P. 2, 3, 21.} — When denoting a quality or attribute it is = the abl. qualitatis of Latin grammar, but the restrictions as to its employment in Latin do not exist in Sanskrit. So it is said (Kâçikâ) <skt>api bhavān kamaṇḍalunā chātram adrākṣīt} (have you seen a disciple with a pitcher?), ibid, on P. 2, 3, 37 <skt>yo jaṭābhiḥ sa bhuṃkto}; so Hitop. 125 <skt>koṣaḥ svalpavyayena} (a treasury with little expenses) comm. <skt>svalpavyayena viśeṣaṇe tṛtīyā}; R. 3, 7, 3 <skt>vividhair drumaiḥ kānanam} (a forest with manifold trees).</p>
    <p>Examples of its attending a verb. — Then it has the nature of Lat. abl. modi or circumstantiae. R. 2, 64, 47 <skt>sa tu divyena rūpeṇa svargamadhyāruhat kṣipram}, Panc. 161 <skt>varo mahatā vādyaśabdenāgacchati} (a bridegroom approaches with a great noise of music), ibid. 28 <skt>tasya sakāśaṃ gatvā bhrātṛsnehenaikatra bhakṣaṇapānaviharaṇakriyābhir ekasthānāśrayeṇa kālo neyaḥ [sc. tvayā]} (go to him and while living brotherly with him on the same spot, spend the time with eating, drinking, walking together), ibid. 162 <skt>anena vārttāvyatikareṇa rajanī vyuṣṭā} (while discoursing thus, the night passed away).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Note <skt>vartate} with instrum. »to behave in such a manner,’’ Panc. 56 <skt>taṃ maryādāvyatikrameṇa vartamāṇam ālokya}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Such instrumentals have often the character of adverbs and may be considered so (77). Among others we mention compounds in <skt>-rūpeṇa} and <skt>-krameṇa}, when = »as, by the way of.” Mrcch. V, p.187 <skt>dravībhūtaṃ manye patati jalarūpeṇa gaganam} (methinks, the firmament dissolves and falls down as rain).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. In some turns the instrumental of circumstance may show something of the fundamental character of the sociative. So R. 2, 37, 18 <skt>lakṣmaṇena sahāyena vanaṃ gacchasva putraka} (<i>with L. as your companion</span> go to the forest, my son), ibid. 2, 30, 27 <skt>na devi tava duḥkhena svargam apy abhirocaye} (I should forsake even heaven, my queen, if its attainment would be <i>joint with</span> grief of you). Similarly Panc. 309 <skt>jālahastadhīvarāḥ rabhūtair matsyair vyāpāditair mastake vidhṛtair astamanavelāyāṃ tasmiñ ca lāśaye samāyātāḥ} (the fishermen arrived with a great number of fishes they had killed and bore on their head). Here we are, indeed, on the very boundary of the sociative and the instr. of quality.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Pâṇ.’s sûtra is <skt>itthaṃbhūtalakṣaṇe [sc. tṛtīyā]}, which is expounded by Kâç. = <skt>itthaṃbhūtasya lakṣaṇe} »to name the laxaṇa or mark, which makes known somebody or something as possessing such quality, property, nature etc.” It includes therefore the notions <i>quality, attribute, circumstance</span>.</p>
