    <p>70. 5. Price.</p>
    <p>5. price or value. — Examples: Panc. 318 <skt>tato’jābhiḥ prabhūtā gā grahīṣyāmi gobhirmahiṣīrmahiṣībhirvaḍavāḥ}, Kâç. on P. 2, 3, 18 <skt>sāhasreṇa paśūn krīṇāti}<i> </span>(*tn-1), Panc. 3 <skt>nāhaṃ vidyāvikrayaṃ śāsanaśatenāpi karomi}, R. 2, 34, 40 <skt>apakramaṇam eva sarve kāmair ahaṃ vṛṇe} (I choose exile, were it at the price of all my wishes).</p>
    <p>Likewise the instrum. is used to denote that, which is given in exchange for something: Panc. 152 <skt>gṛhṇātu kaścid aluñcitair luñcitāṃs tilān} (who takes [from me] peeled sesame in exchange for unpeeled?)</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. The last but one example admits however also of an other interpretation, as <skt>sarvakāmaiḥ} may signify »above all my wishes.” There are a good deal of instances proving, that Sanskrit had, especially in the ancient dialect, an instrum. <i>of the thing surpassed</span> of the same power as the so called <i>ablativus comparationis</span>. More on this subject see <<b>>107</span>.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. {P. 1, 4, 44} The verb <skt>parikrī} (to hire) may be construed either with the <i>instrum.</span> or with the <i>dative</span> of the wages; <skt>śatena} or <skt>śatāya parikrītaḥ}. Both conceptions are logically right.</p>

    <p>Comparing this sentences ‘Kâç. on P. 2, 3, 18 <i>sāhasreṇa paśūn krīṇāti</span>’ and Kāśikāvṛtti on GRETIL, in the latter “sāhasreṇa” is replaced by “pañcakena”. See below.</p>
