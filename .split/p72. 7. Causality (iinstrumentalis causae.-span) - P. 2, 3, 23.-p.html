    <p>72. 7. Causality (<i>instrumentalis causae.</span>) / P. 2, 3, 23.</p>
    <p>7. cause, motive, reason. — Examples: Daç. 198 <skt>ko ‘pi kumāraḥ kṣudhā tṛṣā ca kliśyan} (some boy, vexed by hunger and thirst), Ch. Up. 4, 10, 3 <skt>sa ha vyādhinā ‘naśituṃ dadhre} (from sorrow he was not able to eat), Çâk. IV <skt>bhartur viprakṛtāpi roṣaṇatayā mā sma pratīpaṃ gamaḥ} (even when Injured by your husband you should not oppose him from wrath).</p>
    <p>Causality is also expressed by the <i>ablative</span>, and in some cases the latter is to be employed exclusively. But commonly both constructions are promiscuous and occasionally found together in the same sentence. Panc. IV, 34 <skt>nāmṛtaṃ na viṣaṃ kiñcid ekāṃ muktvā nitambinīṃ / yasyāḥ saṅgena jīvyeta mriyeta ca viyogataḥ} (nothing is ambrosia and poison at the same time, woman alone excepted, by whose union one lives, and the separation of whom causes death), Kathâs. 29, 25 <skt>harṣeṇa naṣṭāsyāḥ kṣunna rogataḥ} (it is from joy she has no appetite, not from illness).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. (P. 2, 3, 24 sq.) The ablative is forbidden and accordingly the instrumental is of necessity, if 1ly the cause or motive be at the same time the agent, see <<b>>102</span>, 2ly if it be an abstract noun of the <i>feminine</span> gender, expressing a quality. (*1) It may thus be said <skt>vīryeṇa} or <skt>vīryān muktaḥ} (released by heroism), but only <skt>bhiyā palāyitaḥ} (he fled from fear). Hence often the abl. of a masc. and neuter and the instr. of the feminine range together, as R. 2, 70, 25 <skt>babhūva hy asya hṛdaye cintā sumahatī tadā / tvarayā cāpi dṛtānāṃ svapnasyāpi ca darśanāt}, or Prabodh. II, p.31 <skt>bālaḥ khalvasi mayā dvāparānte dṛṣṭaḥ / saṃprati kālaviprakarṣād vārdhakagrastatayā ca na samyakpratyabhijānāmi} (as you were a boy, forsooth, I have seen you at the end of the Dvâpara-age, now by length of time and by my being vexed by old age I did not recognise you exactly). In scientific and philosophical works, commentaries and the like, ablatives in <skt>-tvāt} alternate with instrumentals in <skt>-tayā} in order to denote the cause or the moving principle.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>P. 2, 8, 25 perhaps admits of two interpretations. The words <skt>vibhāṣā guṇe ‘striyām} may signify »optional, when expressing a quality, provided this quality is no feminine” or »<i>optional</span>, when expressing a quality; <i>not at all</span>, if [the motive be] a feminine.” Moreover the term <i>strî</span> may denote as well <i>all feminines</span>, as only such, as have special feminine endings. — At all events, in practice, when signifying causality, the ablative with the special femin. ending <skt>-āḥ} is always avoided.</p>
