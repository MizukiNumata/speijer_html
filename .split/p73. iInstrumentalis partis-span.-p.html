    <p>73. <i>Instrumentalis partis</span>.</p>
    <p>Next to the instrumental of causality comes that, which signifies <i>by what side</span>. Like the Latin abl. partis it commonly depends on adjectives, but may also be the complement of the whole predicate. It is especially used to point out the <i>points of comparison</span> with verbs or nouns, which denote superiority or inferiority, likeness or difference.</p>
    <p>Examples: R. 1, 1, 55 <skt>rūpeṇa vikṛtaḥ} (disfigured), Ch. Up. 2, 11, 2 <skt>mahān prajñayā paśubhir bhavati mahān kīrttyā}, Daç. 77 <skt>kalāguṇaiḥ samṛddho vasunā nātipuṣṭo ‘bhavat} (he was rich in various kinds of knowledge and in good qualities, but not very bulky in earthly goods), Panc. 274 <skt>kim aham etābhyāṃ śauryeṇa rūpeṇa vidyābhyāsena kauśalena vā hīnaḥ} (am I inferior to both of them either in valour or in outer appearance or in study or in cleverness?), Daç. 177 <skt>abhijanena vibhavena rājāntaraṅgabhāvena ca sarvapaurānatītya vartate} (he is surpassing all his citizens by his birth, his wealth and his being the king’s confident), Çâk. V <skt>anubhavati hi mūrdhnā pādapastīvramuṣṇam śamayati paritāpaṃ chāyayā saṃśritānām} (the tree does tolerate the ardent glow of the sun on its summit to assuage by its shade the heat of those who come to it for shelter). In the last example, the instr. <skt>chāyayā} may also be accepted as the instrument. In practice, indeed, the different shades of the how-case do not show themselves so sharply, as they are exhibited by the standard-types, cp. <b>64</span>.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. Concurrent idioms denoting the side by which, are the ablative and the locative, especially if it be wanted to express the points of comparison. It is even allowed to use them side by side. So R. 1, 17, 13 two instrumental are used together with an abl. (<skt>tejasā yaśasā vīryād atyaricyata), Mhbh. 1, 16, 9 they range with a locative (<skt>dvau putrau vinatā vavre kadrūputrādhikau bale / tejasā vapuṣā caiva}).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. (P. 2, 3, 20.) The instrumental is of necessity, when naming the part of the body, by which one suffers, as <skt>akṣṇā kāṇaḥ} (blind of one eye), <skt>pāṇinā kuṇiḥ}, <skt>pādena khañcaḥ}. Ch. Up. 2, 19, 2 <skt>ya evaṃ veda nāṅgena vihūrchati} (he who knows so, is not crippled in any limb).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. With comparatives and the like the instrumental is equivalent to the Latin ablativus mensurae. Daç. 73 <skt>kenāṃśenārthakāmātiśāyī dharmaḥ} (by how much is duty superior to interest and pleasure?), Utp. on Varâh. Brhats (translation of Kern p.7) <skt>amuko graha etāvaḍiryojanair bhūgolād upari bhramati} (finch a planet moves so many yojanas above the terrestrial globe).</p>
