    <p>74. Special construction.</p>
    <p>The instrumental is used in many idiomatic turns, most of which belong to the general heads described in the preceding paragraphs. Of them the most important are :</p>
    <p>1. <i>to honour-, to favour-, to attend on with</span> Çâk. I <skt>kalidāsagrathitavastunā navena nāṭakenopasyātavyam asmābhiḥ} (we want to wait upon you with a new drama etc.), Panc, III, 139 <skt>svairmāṃsairnimantritaḥ}. [sc. <skt>kapotena śatruḥ}].</p>
    <p>2. <i>to swear-, to conjure by</span>. R. 2, 48, 23 <skt>putrair api śapāmahe} (we swear; even by our children); Mrcch. III (p.126) <skt>asmac charīraspṛṣṭikayā śāpito ’si}; Mhbh. 1, 131, 46 <skt>satyena te śape}. — Likewise <skt>tena satyena}, an elliptical phrase = <skt>yathā mayoktaṃ satyaṃ tena satyena} (as I have said the truth, by that truth), cp. Ch. Up. 3, 11, 2; Nala. 5, 17-20.</p>
    <p>3. <i>to boast on</span>. Mhbh. 2, 64, 1 <skt>pareṣām eva yaśasā ślāghase tvam}.</p>
    <p>4. <i>to live by</span>. M. 3, 162 <i>nakSatrairyazca jIvati</span> (v. a. an astrologer), Çâk. VII <i>prāṇānāmanilena vṛttiḥ</span>.</p>
    <p>5. <i>to rejoice, to laugh, to wonder etc. at</span>. Mhbh. 1, 138, 71 <i>prIye tvayAham</span> (you make me glad), Mudr. VII p.221 <i>guNairna parituSyAmo yasya</span> (with whose virtues I am not content), Kathâs. 20, 43 <i>jahAsa tena sa nRpaH</span> (the king laughed at it). Cp. <i>sAdhu</span> (bravo, well done) with instr. Mâlat. I (p.8) <i>sAdhu vatse sAdhvanena matpriyAbhiyogena</span>.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the case of 4. and 5. the ablative may occasionally be made use of. That <i>AjIv, upajIv, has, zuc</span>, may be transitives, has been stated 43 and 42, 4; the last (zocati) is commonly</p>
    <p>construed so, and does but rarely comply with the instr.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. With <i>ram</span>, <i>krID</span> and the like the instrum. may be either the sociative proper (then <i>saha, samam</span> etc. may be added) or the karana. Ch. Up. 8, 12, 3 gives a fair instance of its standing on the bordering line of both acceptations <i>jakSankrIDanramamANaH strIbhirvA yAnairvA jJAtibhirvA</span> (laughing [or eating], playing and rejoicing with women, carriages or relatives),</p>
    <p>6. <i>to fill with</span>. Panc. 317 <i>tena bhikSArjitaiH saktubhirbhuktazeSaiH kalazaH saMpUritaH</span> (what was left of his store of barley, he had earned by begging, therewith he filled his bowl), Mudr. V p.184 <i>te pAMsubhiH pUryantAm</span>. — The <i>genitive</span> with words of filling is also met with, yet the general use prefers the instrumental, at least with <i>pUrayati</span>.</p>
    <p>7. <i>to vanquish in (a battle, etc.)</span>. Panc. 291 <i>taM ripuM yuddhena paribhUya</span>.</p>
    <p>8. <i>to carry-, to keep-, to bear on (in, with.)</span> Panc. III, 202 <i>rathakAraH svakAM bhAryAM sajArAM zarasAvahat</span> (the cartwright carried his wife with hor paramour on his head), Daç, 110 <i>matpituruttamAGgamutsaGgena dhArayantI</span>.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the cases of 7 and 8 the locative is the concurrent idiom. It is said promiscuously <i>yuddhe</span> and <i>yuddhena jitam</span>, <i>skandhe</span> or <i>skadhena dhRtam</span>. Cp. Kumâras. 3, 22 <i>bharturājñāmādāya mūrdhnā madanaḥ pratasthe</span> with Kâd. I, p.29 <i>zirasi kRtvAjJAm</span>. But always <i>tulayA dhR</span> »to hold on the balance”, v. a. »to weigh, to compare.”</p>
    <p>9. It is said <i>akSairdIvyati</span> and <i>akSAt</span> (he plays at dice). Cp. also R. (Gorr.) 3, 30, 4 <i>rudhiradhArAbhirvarSanto meghAH</span> with Mhbh. 13, 148, 2 <i>parjanyo vavRSe nirmalaM payaH</span>, Lat, <i>pluit lapides</span> or <i>lapidibus</span>. — Similarly <i>zapathaM zapati</span> and <i>zapathena</span></p>
    <p>(to swear an oath).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the old dialect of the Vedic mantras the instrum. attends on <i>patyate</span> and <i>bhuj</span> unjust as the abl. on Latin <i>potiri</span> and <i>fungi</span>, see Delbr. Abl. Loc. Instr. p.65. To the instances adduced there I add the mantra in Âçv. Grhy. 1, 23, 19 <i>tanmAvatu tanmAvizatu tena bhukSiSIya</span>.</p>
