    <p>78. Instrum. of time. / P. 2, 3, 6.</p>
    <p>III. The <<b>>instrumental of time</span> serves to denote in <i>what time</span> something is accomplished. Not rarely this conception coincides with that of the <i>time</span>, <i>after which</span> something is happening. <i>mAsenAnuvAko’dhItaH</span> (the chapter was learned in (after) a month).</p>
    <p>The same applies to space. krozenAnuvAko’dhItaH (*1).</p>
    <p>Examples : Panc. 2 <i>dvAdazabhirvarSairvyAkaraNaM zrUyate</span> (v. a. grammar requires twelve years to be mastered), ibid. 237 <i>katipayairevAhobhirmayUra iva sa balavAnsaMvRttaH</span> (in a few days he [the crow] grew strong like a peacock), Daç. 159 <i>tato’lpIyasA kAlena rAjJaH priygahiSyekaM putramasUta</span> (after some time the king's chief queen was delivered of a son), R. 1, 13, 35 <i>tataH kaizcidahorAtrairupayAtAH mahIkSitaH</span>, Panc. 282 <i>tayorvrajatoryAjanadvayamAtreNAgrataH kAcinnadI samupasthitA</span> (as they went on, after no more than two yojanas the couple came in sight of some river). So <i>dinaiH</span>, <i>divasaiH</span> etc. — »in process of time.&quot;</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. The fundamental conception seems here to be that of concomitancy. Hence it may be explained, how the third case occasionally denotes even <i>at what time</span>, as R. I, 72, 12 <i>ekAhnA</span> (at one</p>
    <p>and the same day) <i>rājaputrīṇāṃ catasḥṇāṃ pāṇīngṛhṇantu catvāro rājaputrā</span>, and such standing phrases as <i>tena kAlena, tena samayena</span> which are especially frequent in Buddhistic and Jain books.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. (P. 2, 3, 45. cp. 4, 2, 4.) The naxatra or constellation, under which something occurs, may be put indifferontly in the third or the seventh case: <i>puSyeNa</span> or <i>puSye pAyasamaznIyAt</span>. Examples of the instrum. Âçv. Grhy. 3, 5, 1 <i>athAto ‘dhyAyopAkaraNamoSdhInAM prAdurbhAve zravaNena…hastena vA</span>, Pat. I, 231 <i>katareNa tiSyeNa gataH</span></p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>The difference between this instrum. <i>of time</span> and the above mentioned <i>acc. of time</span> (54) is illustrated by these examples of the Kaçikâ: It is said <i>mAsenA(krozena)nuvAko’dhItaH</span>, but <i>mAsamadhIto’nuvAko na cAnena gRhItaH</span>, for »if the subject ceases the action before having reached its aim, the instrumental may not be employed.&quot;</p>
