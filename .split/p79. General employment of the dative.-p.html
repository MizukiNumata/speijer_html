    <p>79. General employment of the dative.</p>
    <p>The dative or fourth case serves to point out the <i>destination</span>, and therefore it generally does answer to English <i>to</span> and <i>for</span>, Latin <i>ad</span> or <i>in</span> with acc. Yet, if it be wanted to express the destination of a real going or moving, the accusative (39) or locative (134) are commonly preferred, although the dative may be used even then, [grAmAya gacchati] being as correct as [grAmaM gacchati].</p>
