    <p>80. Dat. of the destnation.</p>
    <p>In the great majority of cases the destination purported by the dative, has an acceptation more or less figurative. The different kinds of datives, which display this character, may be arranged in two distinct groups, viz I, the so-called <i>dative of concern or interest</span>, II, the <i>dative of the purpose</span>. The former has almost the same functions as the dative of modern european languages, the sphere of the latter is that of the dativus finalis in Latin.</p>
    <p>Both are but varieties of the fundamental notion, as will be made plain by these examples, which contain some datives of the kind I and II, construed with the verb <i>to go</span>. I. Hitop. p.42 <i>na devAya na viprAya na bandhubhyo na cAtmane / kRpaNasya dhanaM yAti cahnitaskarapArthivaiH</span> (the riches of the miser go neither to a god nor to a brahman, nor to his family nor to himself, because of fire, thieves, the king). II. R. 1, 46, 7 <i>ityuktvA tapase yayo</span> (after these words he set out to penance, viz. in order to do penance), Ven. II (p. 39) <i>gaccha tvam훮tmavy훮p훮r훮ya</span> (go to your business).</p>
