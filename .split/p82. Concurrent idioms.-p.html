    <p>82. Concurrent idioms.</p>
    <p>In these and similar instances it is not the use of the dative, which should be noticed, <i>but the faculty of employing in a large amount of cases instead of it some other case, mostly a genitive or a locative</span> (cp. 129 and 145). Some words even seem wholly to avoid the dative of concern; <i>vikrI</span> (to sell) is generally construed with the locative of the purchaser, <i>kSam</span> (to pardon) with a genitive, adjectives as <i>priya, anurUpa, ucita, yukta</span> are as a rule construed with a genitive, etc.</p>
