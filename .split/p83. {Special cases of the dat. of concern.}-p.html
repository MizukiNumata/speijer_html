    <p>83. {Special cases of the dat. of concern.}</p>
    <p>83. In some special cases the use of the dative is enjoined by vernacular grammarians; of the kind are:</p>
    <p>1. The dat. with hita (good for). Cp. Pat. I, 450; Pân. 5, l, 5 [tasmai hitam]. Even here the gen, may be used, see f. i. R. 3, 36, 24.</p>
    <p>2. The dative of the creditor with [dhArapati] (to owe). {P. 1, 4, 35.}</p>
    <p>3. Some utterances of ritual, almost = „hail” to — as [namaH], [svAhA], [svadhA], [vaSada], likewise most phrases of blessing and salutation. They are construed with a dative, but some of them (*1) either wjth dat. or with genitive. (P. 2, 3, 16; 2, 3, 73.) [namo rudrAyya], [svadhA pitRbhyaH], [svasti prajAbhyaH], [AyuSyaM tubhyam] or [tava bhUyAt], [kuzalaM devadattasya] and [devadattAya]. Vikram. p. 62 [svAgataM devyai]. In the ninth act of the Mrcch. Cârudatta greets the judges with an [adhikRtebhyaH svasti], wherea the chief judge answers him [svAgatamAryasya]. But R. 3, 24, 21 [svasti] is construed with a gen. [svasti gobrAhmaNAnaM].</p>
    <p>4. Verbs of anger, jealousy, injuring, discontent agree with the dative of the object of the animosity. {P. 1, 4, 37.} Mhbh. 1, 3, 186 [nRpatistakSakAya cukopa ha] (the king felt angry towards Taxaka), Kathâs. 17, 44 [nAsyai cukrodha], Âpast. 1, 1, 14 [tasmai na druhyetkadAcana] (him he should never offend), Ait Br. 8, 23, 11 [tasmAdevaM viduSe brAhmaNAyaivaM cakuSe na kSatriyo druhyet], Kâd. I, 217 [asUyanti sacivopadezAya] (they find fault with the advice of their ministers), Mahâv. I (p.18) [spRhayAmi rAjJe dezarathAya] (I am jealous of king Daçaratha).</p>
    <p>Rem, Yet with [asUyati] (to find fault with) and [druhyati] (to hurt) the acc, with those of anger and jealousy the gen. and loc. or [prati] are also available. When compounded, [druh] and [krudh] must agree with acc, [devadattAya krudhyati] but [devadattamabhikrudhyati]. {P. 1, 4, 38.}</p>
    <p>5. Some other verbs, enumerated by Pânini, via. [zlAgh] (to praise), [ha] (to conceal), [zap] (to swear, to conjure) and [sthA]. {P. 1, 4, 34.} Here the dative is required of him, whom it is wanted to inform of something, f. i. [devadattAya zlAghte] »he praises to N.N.&quot; [here N.N. is the person addressed], Prabodh. III, p. 66 [buddhebhyaH zatazaH zaye] (I swear a hundred times to the Buddhas), Naish. 1, 49 <span style="background-color: #e1ff49;">[apahavAnasya janAya nijAmadhIratAm]</span> (concealing from the people his unsteadiness). — As to [sthA], it is not plain, what meaning it has here. By comparing P. 1, 3, 23 with the examples adduced, there by Kâçikâ, [tiSTate] with a dat. may be = »he presents or he discovers himself to (*2),&quot; but [syA] with a dat. may also have had the meaning »to have faith in —, affection to,&quot; Çvetâçv. Up. 3, 2 [eko hi rudro na hi dvitIyAya tasyuH], Naish. 7, 57.</p>
    <p>6. P. 1, 4, 41 enjoins a dat. with the compound verbs [anugRNAti] and [pratigRNAti] being technical terms of the ritual »to utter [a certain formula] after — , in reply to another.&quot; (*3).</p>
    <p>7. P. 1, 4, 33 mentions a dat. with verbs of <i>casting one’s na tivity</span> etc., like [rAdh], [rikS], to denote him, on whose behalf this is done. We have here an instance of the dative of profit, treated in the following paragraph.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>Viz. [AyuSya], [madra], [bhadra], [kuzala], [sukha], [artha], [hita] and their synonyms (vârtt. on P. 2, 3, 73).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>The examples of Kaç. on 1, 3, 23 are [tiSTate kanyA chAtrebhyaH / tiSTate kRSalo grAmaputrebhyaH]; here [tiSTate] is said to be = [prakAzayatyAtmAnam].</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>The old language seems to have allowed more of such datives with compound verbs, so as to be the counterpart of Latin <i>instat hosti, occurril mihi</span> and the like. So Âpast. I, 14, 15 [viSamagatAyAgurave nAbhivAdhyam], ibid. II, 11, 3 [rAjA daNDAya pratiyadhyeta] [instead of [daNDaM pra-]]. A curious dative of the same kind, it seems , is Daç. 149 [yAvadAyuratratyAyai devatAyai pratizayiSyAmi].</p>
