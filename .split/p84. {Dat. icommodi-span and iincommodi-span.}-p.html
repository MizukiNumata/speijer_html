    <p>84. {Dat. <i>commodi</span> and <i>incommodi</span>.}</p>
    <p>Sometimes the dative involves the notion of some profit or damage caused by the action (<i>dativus commodi et incommodi</span>). Ch. Up. 6, 16, 1 [apahArSItstenamakArpItparazumasmai tapata] (he has taken something, he has committed a theft, heat the hatchet for him), Kâm. 3, 9 [AdhivyAdhiparItAya adhya zvo vA vinAzine / ko hi nAma zarIrAya dharmApetaM samAcaret] (for who, indeed, would do wrong <i>for the sake</span> of his body, a thing beset by sorrow and disease and destined to die some day or other?), Daç. Uttar. page 19 of the ed. of Damaruvallabhaçarman [asyai dAsyamadhyaprabhRtyabhyupetaM mayA] (from this day I have come in bondage of her), Çak. III [ahamapi tAcadvaitAnikaM zAntudakamasyai gotamIhaste visarjayiSyAmi].</p>
    <p>Here, as in <b>82</span>, it is not the dative, that is remarkable, but the faculty of substituting for it the genitive, as Çak, III [kasyedamanulepanaM mRNAlavanti ca nalinIpatrANi nIyante] (whom</p>
    <p>this ointment and these lotus-leaves are sent for?). The dat. commodi is often periphrased by [artham], [arthe], [kRte] sim.</p>
