    <p>II. The <<b>>dative of the purpose or aim</span> is of very firequent occurrence. It may be made use of always, if one wants to denote either the thing wished for <i>or</span> the action intended. Of the former kind are such datives as [phalebhyo yAti] (he goes out for fruits), [yUpAya dAru] (wood for a sacrificial stake), [kuNDalAya hiraNyam] (gold for a ring), Hitop. 95 [upAyo jIvanAya].</p>
    <p>In the latter case the <i>nomen actionis</span> itself is put in the dative and has the power of an infinitive. Çâk. I [ArtatrANAya vaH zastraM na prahartumanAgasi] (your weapon serves to protect the afflicted, not to hurt the innocent). Here of two actions equally aimed at, one is expressed by the dative of a nomen actionis, the other by an infinitive. The third concurrent idiom is using periphrase by means of such words as [artham], [nimittam] = „for the sake of.” Prabodh. V, p. 100 [vedasaMrakSaNAya nAstikapakSapratikSepArthaM ca zAstrANAM sAMhatyamasti] (the systems [of philosophy] keep together for the sake of guarding the Veda and combating the party of the atheists).</p>

V, p. 113 [idAnIM jJAtInAmudakapriyAyai bhAgIrathImavitarAmaH] (now, let us plunge into the Ganges for the bathing-ceremony for our kinsmen), Hitop. 7 [eteSAmasmatoutrANAM nItizAstropadezAya bhavantiH pramANam] (you have full power to instruct these my sons in the doctrine of politics so as you like best), Ven.
