    <p>Some idioms, though implied by the general description, given in the preceding paragraph, are worth special notice.</p>
    <p>1. The datives of abstract nouns, when expressing „to serve to, to conduce to.” They often make up the whole predicate. — Examples: Pat. I, 11 [taiva tadna doSAya bhavati nAbhyudayAya] (v. a. it is neither good nor evil), Panc. III, 103 [paropakAraH puNyAya pApAya parapIDnam], ibid. p. 192 [laghUnAmapi saMzrayo rakSAyai bhavati] (even if weak people keep together, it may afford protection). Cp. thp marriage-mantra in Âçv. Grhy. 1, 7, 3 [gRbhNAmi te saubhagatvAya hastam] (I take your hand for happiness’ sake). Compare Latin <i>haec res tibi est laudi</span>.</p>
    <p>Similarly [saMyaghyate] with dat. — »to turn, to change into”, [kalpate] (to suit) see <b>85</span>.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. A vârtt. on Pân. 2, 3, 13 gives a special rule on the dative, when serving to explain a prognostic as [vAtAya kapilA vidhyudAtapAyAtilohinI / pItA varSAya vijJeyA durbhikSAya sitA bhavet].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. The person, to whom something will conduce to good, evil etc., is put in the genitive: [tavaitadhyazase] (this will be to your glory), cp. 130. — In the archaic dialect, however, we have two datives, one of the concern and one of the aim, just as in Latin. A. V. 1, 29, 4 [rASTrAya mahyaM badhyatAM sapatnebhyaH parAbhuve] (let I put it on [viz. the <i>mani</span>], for acquiring my kingdom for myself and defeat for my rivals); Rgv. 2, 1; Ait Br. 2, 3, 3 [devebhyo vai pazavo ‘nnAdhyAyAlambhAya] (the sacrificial victims did not stand still to the gods for the sake of being used as food and immolated).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. With [manyate] (to hold for) the predicative dative may be used instead of the acc. (32, <i>c</span>), if contempt is to be expressed; names of animated beings are excepted and should therefore be put exclusively in the acc. So Pânini (2, 3, 17). Kâç. [na tvA tRNaM] or [tRNAya manye / busam] or [busAya]; yet it allows the dat. of [zvan]; [na tvA zvAnaM] or [zune manye]. Instances of this dative in literature I have but found for [tRNAya], see Petr. Dict. s. v. and Daç. 88 [kuberadattastRNAya atvArthapatim] »Kub. <i>does not tare a straw for Arth.</span>&quot;</p>
