    <p>9. Participles, doing duty of finite verbs.</p>
    <p>Participles, especially those in <skt>ta} and <skt>tavant} and the <skt>krtyâs} are frequently employed as if they were finite verbs, without the attendance of the verb subst. In simple prose a great deal of the sentences are moulded in that shape. Hitop. 12 <skt>asau vyāghreṇa vyāpāditaḥ khāditaśca} (the tiger killed him and devoured him), ibid. 7 <skt>tasya viṣṇuśarmaṇaḥ putrān samarpitavān} (he entrusted his sons to the foresaid Vishn.), Çâk. I <skt>vinītaveṣeṇa praveṣṭavyāni tapovanāni nāma} (surely, the hermitages should he entered in modest dress).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The participles of the present and the future do not partake of this construction, cp. P. 3, 2, 124 with 126 (*1).</p>

    <p id="hoge" type="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>A vârtt. to P. 3, 2, 124 states an exception for the case, that the negation <skt>mā} is added to the participle, in order to signify an imprecation. Of this rule applied I know but one instance, Çiçupâl. 2, 45 quoted by the Petr. Dict. s. v. <skt>mā}, V p. 680; but it is not improbable that the author of that poem has done so designedly to show his own skill by applying an out-of-the-way grammatical rule.</p>
