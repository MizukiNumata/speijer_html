    <p>92. {Time-denoting dative.}</p>
    <p>Time-denoting datives may serve for expressing a time to come, when a limit of something to be done. Mâlav. V, p. 139 [mayA..vatsarAtha nivartanIyo nirargalasturaGgamo visarjitaH] (I have set at entire liberty the horse, that it might be brought back after a year).</p>
    <p>Of a similar nature is this dative in R. 2, 62, 17 (Kausalyâ speaks) [vanavAsAya rAmasya paJcarAtro ‘tra gaNyate yaH zokahataharSAyAH paJcavarSopamo mama] »we count now on R.’s exile but five nights, which seem to me as many years.&quot;</p>
