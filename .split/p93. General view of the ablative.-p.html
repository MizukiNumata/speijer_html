    <p>93. General view of the ablative.</p>
    <p>The fifth case or ablative serves to denote the <i>whence</span>, and therefore the very opposite of the dative. Nevertheless both cases are formally identical in the dual and the plural. (*1) In the singular the form of the ablative often coincides with that of the genitive. It is but the ablatives in [-At], that are exclusively expressive of the fifth case. Moreover those made by means of the adverbial suffix [-taH] are not seldom preferred to the regular ablatives of the singular, ambiguousness being wholly excluded from them.</p>
    <p>For easiness’ sake we will treat of this case under four general heads, I abl. of separation, II abl. of distance, III abl. of origin and cause, IV abl. expressing „on what side.” In all of them, however, the unity of the fundamental conception is evident, and sometimes one may account for the same ablative in more than one way.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>In the dual the same form discharges even the functions of three: abl., instr. and dative. As we cannot doubt, that <i>-bhyâm</span> and <i>-bhyas</span> contain the same element <i>-bhi</span>, which is in the suffix <i>-bhis</span> and Greek <i>-φι</span>, it is upon the neuter territory of the instrumental, that the two contrarious conceptions of abl. and dat. must have met together.</p>
