    <p>II. The point from whence a distance is counted (<i>terminus a quo</span>), is expressed by the ablative. Pat. I, p. 455 [gavIdhUmataH sAMkAzyaM catvAri yojanAni] (from Gavîdhûma to Sânkâçya four <i>yojanas</span>). Hence the ablative joins <i>a.</span>) such prepp. as [A], [prabhRti], etc., <i>b.</span>) the names of the cardinal points and those in [-aJc], as [prAJc], <i>c.</span>), all words meaning <i>far</span>, as [dUre] and the like.</p>
    <p>Examples: — of</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) see in chapter IX.</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) Daç. 156 [torthasthAnAtprAcyAM dizi] (east from the <i>tîrth</span>), Pat. I, p. 475 see Rem. 1. on this paragraph. {P. 2, 3, 29.}</p>
    <p>c. ) Mrcch. VII, p. 234 [aho nagarAtsudUramapakrAnto ‘smi], Mhbh. 1, 152, 1 [avidUre vanAttasmAt], ibid. 1, 151, 44 [nAtidRreNa…vanAdasmAt], Âpast. 1, 31, 2 [ArAdavasathAndUtrapurISe kuryAt] (he shall void excrements far from</p>
    <p>his house).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. With derived adverbs of the species [dakSiNataH], [uttarataH] (*1) the genitive should be employed, not the ablative [P. 2, 3, 30], with those in [-ena] the accusative [ibid. 31]. Hence it is said for ex. R. 3, 4, 27 [zvabhramakhanatpArzvatastasya] (he dug a hole by his side), Pat. I, p. 475 [kaH punarAryavartaH / prAgAdarzAtpratyakakAlakavanAdna dakSiNena himavantvantamuttareNa pAriyAtram] (what is Âryavarta? The country east of Âdarça, west of Kâlakavana, south of the Himavat and north of Pâriyâtra), Çâk. I [dakSiNena vRkSavATikamAlApa iva zrUyate]. — But the genitive with those in [-ena] is also allowed [see Kâç. on P. 2, 3, 31], as R. 3, 13, 21 [uttareNAsya] (north of this place).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Pāṇini [2, 3, 34] allows optional construing with abl. or gen. all words, meaning <i>far</span> and <i>near</span>, [dUraM grAmAt] or [grAmasya / antikaM grAmAt] or [grAmasya]. As far as I have observed, an ablative with those of nearness — except compounds of [dUra] — will be scarcely met with in literature.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>P. [SaSThyatasarthapratyayena]. — Kâç. gives as instances also [purastAt], [upari], [upariSTAt]. That on the other hand the abl. is available, even if the adverb itself have the ending of that case, is exemplified by this çloka quoted by Pat. 1, 457.</p>
