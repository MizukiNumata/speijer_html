    <p>When denoting time, the ablative carries the meaning of <i>from, since, after</span>. Commonly it is attended by prepositions, as [A], [prabhRti], [durdhvam], [anantaram], but there are instances enough of the single ablative. So [muhUrtAt], [kSaNAt] (after a while) = [muhUrtena], [kSaNena]. Likewise [cirAt], [acirAt], [dIrghakAlAt], etc. and cp. 128. Kâç. on P. 2, 3, 54 quotes the verse [eti jIvantamAnando naraM varSazatAdapi] (even after hundred years a man may enjoy happiness); Mhbh. 1, 170, 3 [te tvagacchannahorAtrAttIrtham], M. 8, 108 [yasya dRzyeta saptAhAduktavAvyasya sAkSiNaH / rogaH] (if a witness, who has borne evidence, fall ill after a week).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. This kind of abl. is meant by P. 2, 3, 7, when he enjoins the use of a fifth or seventh case to denote an interval of time or space, f. ex. [adya bhuktvA devadatto dyahe dyahAdvA bhoktA] (D. has eaten now and will not eat but after two days), [ihastho ‘yamiSvAsaH kroze] (or [krozAt]) [lakSyaM vidhyati]. Cp. 144.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Âpast. 1, 9, 6 and 1, 15, 19 are instances of the single ablative = [A] + abl., when signifying »till.”</p>
