    <p>I. PREPOSITIONS(*2).</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>Indian grammar, which does not possess, as we do, that heterogeneous set of terms styled <i>parts of speech</span>, has no term exactly answering to our »prepositions,” but it calls them by different names according to their phonetical, etymological or syntactical properties. When compounded with roots, so as to make up compound verbs and the like, they are styled <i>upasarga</span>. But the same particles will be styled <i>karmapravacanîya</span>, when separate words. For this reason, the karmapravacanîya-class does not comprise such prepp., as [upari], [puraH], [saha], but on the other hand it contains some particles, which cannot at any rate, be called »prepositions,” as [api], [su]. Op. P. 1, 4, 68; 59; 88-98.</p>
