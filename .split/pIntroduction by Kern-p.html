    <p>Introduction by Kern</p>
    <p>In order to comply with the wishes of Dr. Speijer I take the liberty to introduce his work with the students of Sanskrit.</p>
    <p>Indian grammar, which is virtually the same as saying Pâṇini’s grammar, superior as it is in many respects to anything of the kind produced among other civilized nations of antiquity, is professedly deficient in its treatment of syntax. As all Sanskrit grammars published by Western scholars are, so far as the linguistical facts are concerned, almost entirely dependent, either directly or indirectly, upon Pâṇini, it cannot be matter for surprise that syntax is not adequately treated in them, although it must be admitted that Professor Whitney’s grammar shows in this respect a signal progress.</p>
    <p>Some parts of Indian syntax have received a careful treatment at the hands of competent scholars, amongst whom Delbrück stands foremost. All who are grateful to those pioneers will, it may be supposed, gladly receive this more comprehensive work, the first complete syntax of classical Sanskrit, for which we are indebted to the labours of Dr. Speijer. May it be the forerunner of a similar work, as copious and conscientious, on Vaidik Syntax!</p>
