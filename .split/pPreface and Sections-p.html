    <p>PREFACE.</p>

    <p>This book aims to give a succinct account of Sanskrit Syntax, as it is represented in classic Sanskrit literature, without neglecting however the archaisms and peculiarities of vaidik prose (brâhmaṇa, upanishad, sûtra) and of epic poetry. The facts laid down here have been stated chiefly by my own observations in perusing Sanskrit writings, and accordingly by far the great majority of the examples quoted have been selected directly from the sources, if not, those suggested by the Petropolitan Dictionary or others have, as a rule, been received only after verification. Moreover, valuable information was gained by the statements of vernacular grammarians, especially of Pāṇini, to whose reverenced authority due respect is paid and whose rules are referred to at every opportunity. For some useful intelligence I am indebted to Mr. Anundoram Borooah's <i>Higher Sanskrit Grammar</span> Calcutta 1879. A welcome and precious assistance were to me some treatises or occasional hints of distinguished European scholars, who, as DELBRÜCK, DE SAUSSURE, WHITNEY, have explored tracks of this scarcely trodden region of Indian philology. But for the greater part of the subjects falling within the scope of this compilation, monographies and special investigations of a sound philological and scholarlike character are still wanting, and I have felt that want often and deeply. For this reason I am fully aware, that many deficiencies and inaccuracies will certainly be found now or appear afterwards in this first Sanskrit Syntax written in Europe. Notwithstanding, as I felt convinced that my labour, however imperfect, might prove of some profit by facilitating both the access to Sanskrit literature and the study of Sanskrit language, and that on the other hand this work might afford some base for further investigations on special points of Syntax, it is placed before the public with the confidence that it may be judged, what it is, as a first attempt, and an attempt undertaken by a foreigner.</p>
    <p>In arranging materials I preferred following, as best I could, the nature and spirit of the language I was working on, rather than clinging too closely to the classification familiar to us by the Syntax of Latin and Greek; in stating facts I have avoided generalizing from such instances as did rest only on my own limited experience, remembering the wise words of Patanjali mahān hi śabdasya prayogaviṣayaḥ …… etāvantaṃ śabdasya prayogaviṣayam ananuniśamya santy aprayuktāḥ iti vacanaṃ kevalaṃ sāhasamātraṃ (Mahabhasya, (Pas_12) KA_I,8.23-10.3 Ro_I,35-39 {48-50})</p>
