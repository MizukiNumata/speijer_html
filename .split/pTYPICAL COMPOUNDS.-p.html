    <p>TYPICAL COMPOUNDS.</p>

    <p>So I call such compounds whose latter element is almost used in a <<b>>typical</span> sense, which is more or less remote from their primitive meaning. By them the great importance of compounding for Sanskrit composition appears best. Such among them, as are fit for periphrasing case-relations, have already been dealt with in Chapter IX, especially 188-196. Of the others the most remarkable are: 1. those in [Adi], [-Adya], [-Adika], [-prabhRti] which are expressive of „and so on,” 2. those in [-pUrvam] and [-puraHsaram] which may serve to make adverbs of manner, 3. those in [-pUrva] =„formerly—,” 4. those in [-mAtram], which does duty of a limitative particle, [vAGmAtram] being nearly the same as [vAgeva], 5. those in [-kalpa], [-dezya], [-dezIya], [-prAya] to express „nearly, almost,” 6. those in [-rUpa], if [rUpa] may be rendered by „namely,” 7. those in [-antaram] when having the worth of „some” or „other.” And so on.</p>
