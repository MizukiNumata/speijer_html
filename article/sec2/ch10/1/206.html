          <h2>206. Its gender and number.</h2>

          <p>
            The dvandva has the gender of its last member. Its number is determined by the real number of the persons or things, comprised by it. <small>Panc. I, 4 <skt>ajātamṛtamūrkhebhyo mṛtājātau sutau varam</skt> (from the three classes of sons: 1 not born at all, 2 sons died, 3. blockheads, the first and second classes are to be preferred), ibid. p. 195 <skt>prāṇāntikaṃ sadaiva vāyasolūkānāṃ vairam</skt> (there always is a deadly hatred between crows and owls), Harshac. p. 28 <skt>nṛtyagotavāditreṣvabāhyāḥ</skt> (no strangers to dancing, singing and playing on instruments). As the number of the members is illimited, we may have such long dvandvas as f. i. Nala 1, 28 <skt>vayaṃ hi devagandharvamānuṣoragarākṣasāndṛṣṭavantaḥ</skt> etc.</small>
          </p>
          <p>But if the dvandva. is to represent a real unity or if not individuals hut categories are linked together, it generally is á neuter and á singular. So it is said <skt>putrapautram</skt> (children and grandchildren), <skt>gavāśvam</skt> (kine and horses), <skt>ārāśastri</skt> (awl and knife).</p>
          <p class="rem" id="206-rem-1-e">Rem. 1. A full and exhaustive account on this subject is given by Pâṇini (2, 4, 2-17) and his commentators. They distinguish between those cases where the dvandva must be a singular and a neuter, those where it must not be so, and those in which it is allowed to use either idiom optionally. So, among others, tho singular of the neuter is of necessity with dvandvas signifying parts either of the body or of musical instruments or of the army, as <skt>pāṇipādam</skt>, <skt>rāyikapādātam</skt> {P. 2, 4, 2.}, likewise if names of rivers and countries, when of different gender, are linked together, as <skt>gaṅgāśoṇam</skt>, <skt>kurukurukṣetram</skt>. {P. 2, 4, 7.} On the other hand, dvandvas made up of nouns denoting animate beings are not allowed to be put in the singular number, save <i>a.</i>) very small animals, as <skt>daṃśamaśakam</skt> {P. 2, 4, 8.}, <i>b.</i>) such as by their nature are living in eternal mutual enmity, as <skt>mārjāramūṣakam</skt> {P. 2, 4, 9.}, <i>c.</i>) classes of çûdras, not considered abject (*1), as <skt>takṣāyaskaram</skt> {P. 2, 4, 10.}, <i>d.</i>) some others as <skt>gavāśvam</skt>, <skt>putrapautram</skt>, <skt>śvacaṇḍālam</skt>, <skt>strīkumāram</skt>. {P. 2, 4, 11.} — Dvandvas of contrasting qualities or things are optionally put in the singular or in the dual, as <skt>sukhaduḥkham</skt> or <skt>-khe</skt>, <skt>śītoṣṇam</skt> or <skt>-ṣṇe</skt>. {P. 2, 4, 13.} And so on.</p>
          <p class="rem" id="206-rem-2-e">Rem. 2. It is forbidden to compound a genus with its species. See Pat, I, p. 252.</p>
          <p class="rem" id="206-rem-3-e">Rem. 3. Instead of the dvandva <skt>mātāpitarau</skt> the simple <skt>pitarau</skt> may be used {P. 1, 2, 70 and 71.} (so f. i. Ragh. 1, 1 <skt>jagataḥ pitarau vande pārvatīparameśvarau</skt>. Likewise <skt>śvaśurau</skt> is synonymous with <skt>śvaśrūśvaśurau</skt>, see f. i. Kathas. 58, 89. — Dvandvas = »brother and sister,” »son and daughter” are not used, here <skt>bhrātarau</skt>, <skt>putrau</skt> are of necessity. {P. 2, 1, 68.} — Cp. Latin <i>soceri</i> = <i>socer et soclus</i>, <i>fratres</i> = <i>frater et soror</i>.</p>
          <p class="rem" id="206-rem-4-e">Rem. 4. As to the order, to be followed in putting together the links of a dvandva, fixed rules cannot be given. {P. 2, 2, 32-34.} Yet it is common to put at the head either the themes ending in <skt>i</skt> or <skt>u</skt>, or those commencing by a vowel while ending in <skt>a</skt>, or the shortest.</p>
