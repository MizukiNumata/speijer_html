          <h2>207. Its significance.</h2>

          <p>Besides its most common duty of expressing coordination, the dvandva is also available, if „and” connects persons or things standing in mutual relation with one another. Another species is the distributive dvandva.</p>
          <small>
            <p>Examples of the dvandva of relationship. — R. 3, 27, 10 <skt>sa saṃprahārastumulo rāmatriśirasostadā / saṃvabhūvātivalinoḥ siṃhakuñjarayor iva</skt> (then a wild battle began between Rama and Triçiras, both of extraordinary strength, as if between a lion and an elephant), Mâlav. I, p. 21 <skt>atra bhavataḥ kila mama ca samudrapalvalayor ivāntaram</skt> (forsooth, there is as great a difference between you and me, as there is between a pond and the ocean), Harshac. 5 <skt>nisargavirodhinī ceyaṃ payaḥ pāvakayor ivaikatra dharmakrodhayor vṛttiḥ</skt> (and like water and fire, so righteousness and auger, <skt>when meeting</skt> at the same place, by their proper nature combat each other).</p>
            <p>Examples of distributive dvandva. — Mâlav. V, p. 137 <skt>tau pṛthagvāradākūle śiṣṭām uttaradakṣiṇe / naktaṃ dinaṃ vibhajyobhau śītoṣṇākiraṇāviva</skt> (let them rule severally the banks of the Varadâ, one the northern bank, but the other the southern, as moon and sun share their sway over night and day); Mudr. I, p. 19 <skt>dvitayaṃ] phalaṃ kopaprītyor dviṣati ca vibhaktaṃ suhṛdi ca</skt> (I have bestowed the double fruit of my wrath and my affection on foe and friend); Kathâs. 25, 229: Açokadatta by his utmost bravery has conquered a golden lotus and presents it to the king his master, who puts the precious flower in a silver vase; on that account the poet makes this comparison <skt>ubhau kalaśapadmau ca śuśubhāte sitāruṇau / yaśaḥ pratāpāviva tau bhūpālāśokadattayoḥ</skt> (and both the vase and tho flower shone, one white, the other red, as if they were that splendour and that glory combined, which adorned one tho king, the other Açokadatta).</p>
