          <p>The former member may be either = a noun-case (as in [tatpuruSaH], [ahihataH]), or = an adjective (as in [navayauvanam]). In the latter case, there exists grammatical concord between the two members; such tatpurushas bear the special appellation of <b>karmadhâraya</b>.</p>

          <h6>karmadhâraya</h6>
          <p>The faculty of combining adjectives with their substantives into karmadhârayas is theoretically almost unrestricted, but in practice not all possible combinations are used <a href="#211-e1">(*1)</a>. Most karmadhârayas are terms often recurring which <i>either</i> have got some special meaning, <i>or</i> are wont to be much employed though nothing impedes expressing them by the two elements severed. Of the former kind are such as [paramAtmA] (the highest soul), [yuvarAjaH] (heir apparent), of the latter such as [kRSNasarpaH] (a black serpent), [pakvAnnam] (cooked rice), and the great class of compounds, a full account of which is given by Pâṇini in the first adhyâya of his second ashtakam (see espec. the sûtras 49, 58, 61, 67 and 70), containing those, the former member of which is a pronoun as [sarva], [eka], [apara], [sva], and such adjectives as [nava], [purANa], [mahA-], [madhya], [madhyam], [sat] (good) etc. To them we may add such words as [nija], [mukhya], [pradhAna], and even such as begin by [su-], [duH-] and the negation [a-], as [sujanaH] (an honest man), [durjanaH] (a bad man), [akovit] (not skilled) .</p>

          <p id="211-e1" type="note">
            (*1)<br />
            Pâṇini’s rule 2, 1, 57 [vizeSaNaM vizeSyeNa bahulam] plainly shows not all combinations of the kind to be allowed.
