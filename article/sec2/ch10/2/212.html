    <p>Yet there are instances enough of a freer employment. Panc. 327 [kimevaM palAyyate ‘lIkabhayena] (why do you run away thus by a falae fear?), Pat. I, p. 2 [zaSkaidhaH] = [zaSkamedhaH], Panc. 30 [anucitasthAna upaviSTaH], Mâlav. I, p. 3 [vartamAnakaveH kAlidAsasya] (of the living poet K.), Harshac. 6 [zailUSa iva vRthA vahasi kRtrimopazamam] (like an actor you are displaying in vain a fictitious tranquillity of mind), Bhoj. 28 [prAktanakarmato dAridhyramanubhavati] (in consequence of his deeds in a former existence he is now poor), Panc. 87 [tvadIyavanam] (your orders), Mâlav. I, p. 28 [yasyAgamaH kevalajIvikAyai] (to whom his learning serves only for a livelihood), Kathâs. 39, 131 [dattvA varAzvam] (— gave a best horse).</p>
    <p>Upon the whole, such freer karmadhârayas are used in a greater extent in poetry, also when being themselves but a member of some large compound, as f. i. Panc. 37 [anekasAdhujanadattasUkSmavastravikrayavazAt] (by selling fine clothes given to him by many pious people), in analyzing which we get [anekasAdhujanai[karm.]rdattAnAM sUkSmavastrANAM [other karm.] vikrayasya vazAt].</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the case of such words as [pApanApitaH], there seems to exist a slight difference between the karmadh. and the analytical construction of the same purport; [pApanApitaH] is ,,a bad barber” who knows his art badly, but [pApo mApitaH] »a barber of a bad temper.” See P. 2, 1, 54.</p>
