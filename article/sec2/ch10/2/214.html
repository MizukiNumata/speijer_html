          <p>
            A proper species of tatpurshas has is made up by those, whose latter members is a verbal noun, the noun predicate of which is signified by the former member. The commonest instances of the kind are adjectives in <skt>-bhūta</skt> (being, making up, behaving as). <small>Pat. I, 39 <skt>pramāṇabhūta ācāryaḥ</skt> (the teacher, who is [the pupil’s] authority), Daç. 176 <skt>tasyāham asmy udāharaṇabhūtā</skt> (I am an example thereof), M. 1, 5 <skt>āsīd idaṃ tamobhūtam</skt>. Moreover there is a class of much used compound verbs, whose former part is a noun, whereas the latter is the verb <skt>kṛ</skt> or <skt>bhū</skt>; they carry the conception of something transformed from one state into another. They will be dealt with when treating of the Syntax of the Verb; see 308.</small>

            <small>Among other similar tatpurushas we notice <i>a.</i>) those ending in <skt>ukta</skt>, <skt>samāmnāta</skt>, <skt>mata</skt>, <skt>samākhyāta</skt>, <skt>kṛta</skt> etc. {P. 2, 1, 59 with Kâç’s comm.} Daç. 61 <skt>sa ca… ambālikāyām abalāratnasamākhyātāyām atimātrābhilāṣaḥ</skt> (he, being passionately in love with Ambâlikâ surnamed: the jewel of womankind); <i>b.</i>) those in <skt>-bruva</skt> (having but the name of) and <skt>-mānin</skt> and <skt>-manya</skt> (thinking one’s self —), as <skt>brāhmaṇabruvaḥ</skt> »one who claims himself a brahman” [on account of his birth, but who does not behave as such], <skt>paṇḍitamānī</skt> (wise in one’s own opinion), Atharvav. 15, 13, 6 <skt>avrātyo ‘vrātyabuvaḥ</skt>, R. 3, 21, 17 <skt>śūramānī na śūrastvam</skt>, Daç. 99 <skt>dhanyaṃmanyaḥ</skt> <a href="#214-e1">(*1)</a>. {P. 3, 2, 83.}</small>
          </p>
          <p class="rem" id="214-rem-e">Rem. Somewhat different is the nature of those, the former part of which is not the predicate, but the predicate’s attribute, as <skt>uttānaśaya</skt> and <skt>avamūrdhaśaya</skt> given as examples by the comm. of vârtt. 3 on P. 3, 2, 15 and <skt>pūrvasara</skt> (going at the head) see P. 3, 2, 19.</p>

            With them may in some degree be compared such tatpurushas as Kathâs. 9, 48 <skt>āmiṣaśaṅkayā</skt> (holding [her] for a piece of raw flesh), Hit. 93 <skt>vyāghrabuddhyā</skt> (taking [him] for a tiger). Here the former member is the predicative object of the verbal noun, which is the latter member.
