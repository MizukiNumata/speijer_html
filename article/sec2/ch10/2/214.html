          <h2>214. Compounds in [-bhUta] and the like, the former member of which is a predicate.</h2>

          <p>A proper species of tatpurshas has is made up by those, whose latter members is a verbal noun, the noun predicate of which is signified by the former member. The commonest instances of the kind are adjectives in [-bhUta] (being, making up, behaving as). Pat. I, 39 [pramANabhUta AcAryaH] (the teacher, predicate. who is [the pupil’s] authority), Daç. 176 [tasyAhamasmyudAharaNabhUtA] (I am an example thereof), M. 1, 5 [AsIdidaM tamobhUtam]. Moreover there is a class of much used compound verbs, whose former part is a noun, whereas the latter is the verb [kR] or [bhU]; they carry the conception of something transformed from one state into another. They will be dealt with when treating of the Syntax of the Verb; see 308.</p>
          <p>Among other similar tatpurushas we notice <i>a.</i>) those ending in [ukta], [samAmnAta], [mata], [samAkhyAta], [kRta] etc. {P. 2, 1, 59 with Kâç’s comm.} Daç. 61 [sa ca…ambAlikAyAmabalAratnasamAkhyAtAyAmatimAtrAbhilASaH] (he, being passionately in love with Ambâlikâ surnamed: the jewel of womankind); <i>b.</i>) those in [-buva] (having but the name of) and [-mAnin] and [-manya] (thinking one’s self —), as [brAhmaNabuvaH] »one who claims himself a brahman” [on account of his birth, but who does not behave as such], [paNDitamAnI] (wise in one’s own opinion), Atharvav. 15, 13, 6 [avrAtyo ‘vrAtyabuvaH], R. 3, 21, 17 [zUramAnI na zUrastvam], Daç. 99 [dhanyaMmanyaH] (*1). {P. 3, 2, 83.}</p>
          <p class="rem" id="214-rem-e">Rem. Somewhat different is the nature of those, the former part of which is not the predicate, but the predicate’s attribute, as [uttAnazaya] and [avamUrdhazaya] given as examples by the comm. of vârtt. 3 on P. 3, 2, 15 and [pUrvasara] (going at the head) see P. 3, 2, 19.</p>

            (*1)<br />
            With them may in some degree be compared such tatpurushas as Kathâs. 9, 48 [AmiSazaGkayA] (holding [her] for a piece of raw flesh), Hit. 93 [vyAghrabuddhyA] (taking [him] for a tiger). Here the former member is the predicative object of the verbal noun, which is the latter member.
