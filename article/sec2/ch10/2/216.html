    <p>216.</p>
    <p>Yet, there are some restrictions. For this reason, Pâṇini when treating of compounds made up of a noun-case + noun, gives a detailed account of them. The summary of which runs in this way:</p>

    <p>{The former member is a genitive.}</p>
    <p>I. As a rule, any genitive may be compounded (<i>shashthîsamâsa</span>). {P. 2, 2, 8.} Some cases are excepted. Among others it is not allowed to use compounds, made up of a genitive + a participle or a gerund or a kṛtya or an infinitive, nor those consisting of a genitive + comparative or superlative or ordinal noun of number, nor such as where a genitive is compounded with some noun in <skt>-tṛ} or <skt>-aka}. {P. 2, 2, 11.} Therefore, such phrases as <skt>manuṣyāṇāṃ śūratamaḥ} (the most heroic of men), <skt>chātrāṇāṃ pañcamaḥ} (the fifth of the disciples), <skt>apāṃ sraṣṭāḥ} (the creator of the waters), <skt>brāhmaṇasya kurvan} or <skt>kṛtvā} or <skt>karaṇīyam} or <skt>kartum} (doing etc. for the benefit of a brahman) are unfit for compounding. {P. 2, 2, 15.} Partitive genitives are likewise excluded, nor is the dative like genitive (129), it seems, as a rule, fit for being compounded. — As little, so we learn from Pâṇini’s commentators (*1) an objective genitive in such cases, as <skt>vicitrā sūtrasya kṛtiḥ pāṇininā}, here it is not allowed to say <skt>sūtrakṛtiḥ pāṇininā}, since both the subject and the object of the action conveyed by the noun <skt>kṛtiḥ} are expressed, for nothing impedes using the compound <skt>sūtrakṛtiḥ} = <skt>sūtrasya kṛtiḥ}, if the agent is not expressed (*2).</p>

    <p>{an accusative;}</p>
    <p>II. compounding the accusative is allowed: {P. 2, 1, 29.} (*3)</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) when being one of time as <skt>māsakalyāṇaḥ}. So R. 2, 71, 18 <skt>saptarātroṣitaḥ pathi}, Mâlat. I, p. 14 <skt>bahudivasopacīyamānam iva manmathavyathāvikāram upalabdhavān asmi};</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) with some participles in <skt>-ta}, with active or intransitive meaning, {P. 2, 1, 24.} as <skt>grāmagataḥ} (gone to the village), <skt>narakapatitaḥ} (fallen to hell), <skt>kaṣṭaśritaḥ} (come to hardship), <skt>sukhaprāptaḥ} (*4) sim. {P. 2, 1, 26.} In practice, there are more. So f. i. the restriction of <skt>khaṭvārūḍha} (P. 2, 1, 26) to a reproachful term does not imply the prohibition of compounding <skt>ārūḍha} otherwise. See but Panc. 51 <skt>kareṇukārūḍhā}, ibid. 30 <skt>gṛhāyātaḥ}</p>

    <p>{an instrumental;}</p>
    <p>III. compounding the instrumental is allowed:</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) if denoting the agent or instrument + some verbal noun, as <skt>ahihataḥ}. {P. 2, l, 32.} The participles in <skt>-tavant} are excepted, compounding <skt>ahinā} + <skt>hatavān} therefore not allowed. — Some proverbial locutions are explicitly named by Pâṇini, as <skt>kākapeyā nadī}, <skt>śvalehyaḥ kūpaḥ}, {P. 2, 1, 33.} but from this it should not be inferred that it is wholly forbidden to make up any other compound of instrumental + kṛtya. Panc. 327 <skt>tvaddakṣyo ‘yaṃ mānuṣaḥ} = <skt>tvayā bha-}. Yet such compounds are not frequent.</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) if the latter member is a word expressive of <i>likeness</span>, <i>equality</span>, <i>superiority</span>, <i>want</span> (*5), see 61 and 78. {P. 2, 1, 31.} Of the kind are such compounds as <skt>pitṛsamaḥ} (equal to his father), <skt>mātṛsadṛśaḥ} (resembling his mother), <skt>māsapūrvaḥ} and <skt>māsāvaraḥ} (earlier —, later by a month), M. 8, 217 <skt>alponaṃ karma} = <skt>alpenonaṃ karma} (<i>v. a.</span> work, almost finished), Panc. 23 <skt>svāmisadṛśā eva bhavanti bhṛtyāḥ};</p>
    <p><i>c.</span>) the instrum. + the words <skt>kalaha} (quarrel), <skt>nipuṇa} (clever); <skt>miśra} (mixed), <skt>ślakṣṇa} (lax). {P. 2, 1, 81.} Kâç. gives these examples: <skt>asikalahaḥ}, <skt>vāṅnipuṇaḥ}, <skt>guḍamiśra}, <skt>ācāraślakṣṇaḥ}. When extending the rule to all words of the same purport, as we may do (see above p. 92 N.), the frequent compounds in <skt>-milita}, <skt>-anvita}, <skt>-yuta}, <skt>-yukta}, <skt>-upeta}, etc. are included, also many of those, the former part of which is an <i>instrumentalis partis</span> (78).</p>
    <p><i>d.</span>) in the case of compound adjectives, the former part of which is an instrumental of causality, illustrative of the adjective it is joined to (*6). {P. 2, 1, 30.} So R. 3, 16, 13 <skt>niḥśvāsāndha ādarśaḥ} (a mirror tarnished by exhalation), ibid. 3, 55, 20 <skt>vīryasamaḥ} (equal by strength), ibid. 2, 118, 4 <skt>guṇaślāghyaḥ} (praiseworthy by his qualities), Panc. I, 39 <skt>jātyādimahotsāhā narendrāḥ} = <skt>jātyādinā mahotsāhā narendrāḥ}, Kumâras. 3, 12 <skt>tapovīryamahatsu} (men, great by their heroic penance). — Of the same kind are the compounds, made up of instrum. + <skt>arthin} (76 R. 1), as Panc. 10 <skt>kiṃ bhavānāhārārthī kevalameva} (are you desirous of nothing but food ?), Kathâs. 24, 176 etc.</p>
    <p><i>e.</span>) in the case of food dressed with some ingredient or by mixing two materials, as <skt>dadhyodanaḥ}, <skt>guḍadhānāḥ}. {P. 2, 1, 34 and 35.} Likewise Daç. 139 <skt>viṣānnam} (empoisoned food).</p>

    <p>{a dative.}</p>
    <p>IV. the dative may be compounded:</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) the dative of the aim in such cases as <skt>yūpadāru} = <skt>yūpāya dāru}, <skt>kuṇḍalahiraṇyam} = <skt>kuṇḍalāya hiraṇyam}; {P. 2, 1, 36.}</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) the dative of the remote object with the words <skt>bali} (offering to), <skt>hita} (good for), <skt>sukha} (pleasant for), <skt>rakṣita} (kept, guarded for) and the like, {P. 2, 1, 36.} as <skt>viṣṇubaliḥ}, <skt>gohitam}, Panc. I, 47 <skt>sā sevā yā prabhuhitā}, etc. — With them is named <skt>artha} »purpose, aim, scope.” On the compounds in <skt>-artha} we have treated 194.</p>

    <p>{an ablative.}</p>
    <p>V. the ablative:</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) with words expressive of <i>fear</span>, as <skt>vṛkabhayam} (fear of wolves), R. 3, 27, 20 <skt>vyādhatrastā mṛgāḥ (deer, afraid of the hunter); {P. 2, 1, 37.}</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) with some participles, which signify a withdrawal (*7). Daç. 89 <skt>nṛtyotthitā sā prātiṣṭhata} (she rose from the dance and went away), M. 2, 89 <skt>sāvitrīpatitaḥ} (one who has forfeited the <i>sâvitrî</span>), R. 3, 25, 24 <skt>cicchidurbibhiduś caiva rāmabāṇā guṇacyutāḥ}.</p>

    <p>{a locative.}</p>
    <p>VI. the locative:</p>
    <p><i>a.</span>) with such nouns as are construed with a locative of reference, as those of <i>attachment</span>, <i>skill</span> and the like (148). {P. 2, 1, 40.} R. 3, 19, 22 <skt>mānuṣau śastrasaṃpannau} (two men, accomplished at arms), Panc. I, 18 <skt>bhāṇḍakrayavicakṣaṇāḥ} (skilled in the commerce of merchandises);</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) in some cases, when denoting a time or a place. Of the kind Pâṇini names compounds in <skt>-siddha} (prepared, dressed), <skt>-śuṣka} (dried), <skt>-pakva} (cooked), <skt>-bandha}, {P. 2, 1, 41.} also parts of the day or night + <skt>kṛta}, {P. 2, 1, 45.} as <skt>sāṃkāśyasiddha} (prepared in Sânkâçya), <skt>ātapaśuṣka} (dried in the sun), <skt>pūrvāhṇakṛta} (done in the forenoon);</p>
    <p><i>c.</span>) in some standing phrases and proverbial locutions, see P. 2, 1, 42-44; 46-48.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>See Kâç. on P. 2, 2, 14; Pat. I, p. 415, vârtt. 6. Pat. himself rejects the interpretation given there.</p>
    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>The <i>shashthîsamâsa</span> is treated by Pâṇini in the second adhyâya of his 2nd book (2, 2, 8-17), some statements are also scattered in the third book, see f. i. 3, 3, 116. Additions ad corrections on them are of course made in the commentaries. But now and then the cavillations of the commentators have rather obscured the good understanding of some rules. So the Kâçikâ is wrong loosening sûtra 2, 2, 14 from its adhikâra, <skt>ktena} and interpreting this rule — <skt>karmaṇi ca} — as if it taught something concerning the objective genitive. Now, as the sûtra could in no way be explained so as to contain a prohibition of compounding any objective genitive whatever, as such compounds are very common indeed, the Kâçika was obliged to add a clause of its own <skt>ubhayaprāptau karmaṇīti ṣaṣṭhyā iti grahaṇam} which statement certainly will be correct by itself, but not the smallest trace of which is to be found in Pâṇini. In fact, Pâṇini has here not thought of an objective genitive. When reading the sûtras 12, 13, 14 at a stretch and without prejudice, one sees plainly that <skt>karmaṇi} of 14 qualifies <skt>ktena} of 12. Sûtra 14 prohibits compounding a <i>genitive</span> + a participle in <skt>-ta} with <i>passive</span> meaning. It is not allowed to say <skt>taddarśitam} instead of <skt>tasya darśitam} (shown <i>to</span> him), whereas Pâṇini allows it, when representing <skt>tena darśitam} (shown <i>by</span> him), cp. 2, 1, 32.</p>
    <p>The following sûtras 15 and 16 — <skt>tṛjakābhyāṃ kartari / kartari ca} — afford a fair sample of absurd hairsplitting. In s. 15 Pâṇini had given a rule about the words in <skt>-tṛ} and <skt>-aka} when denoting the agent; with them a genitive cannot be compounded, save the few instances mentioned 2, 2, 9. Accordingly it is prohibited by Pâṇini to <skt>vajrabhartā} instead of <skt>vajrasya bhartā} (bearer of the thunderbolt) or <skt>odanapācakaḥ} instead of <skt>odanasya pācakaḥ} (one who cooks rice). But some schoolmaster, who commented on our great grammarian, discovered Pâṇini to have omitted some kind of words in <skt>-aka}, which though not-denoting the agent are likewise forbidden to be compounded with a preceding genitive, as <skt>bhavataḥ śāyikā} (your lying down) cp. P. 3, 3, 111. In order to make our sûtra comprise even them, the well-known <i>yogavibhâga</span>-expedient was taken recourse to, and our sûtra was split up in two. One made the discovery that the word <skt>kartari} admitted of two acceptations, according to its being construed either with <skt>tṛjakābhyām} or with the general adhikâra <skt>ṣaṣṭhī}; in other terms, P. could mean either <i>any genitive + agent in <skt>tṛ} or <skt>aka} or the subjective genitive + any noun <skt>tṛ} or <skt>aka}</span>. By combining both and assigning to either an own sûtra the <i>ἀπορία</span> felt by the commentator found its <i>λύσις</span>. See but the artificial interpretation of both in the Kâçikâ. How Patanjali interpreted the rule we do not know, a comment of his on s. 15 and 16 being wanting; from vârtt. 2 on I, p. 415 it appears he was acquainted at least with s. 15.</p>
    <p>In 2, 2, 11 it seems strange, that a special prohibition — that concerning the ordinal nouns of number — is enjoined immediately after the general one (2, 2, 10) which includes also that special case.</p>
    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*3)</p>
    <p>The preceding sûtra 28 is too artfully interpreted by Pat. and Kâç. to have been interpreted well. It is likely, we have here again an instance of distortion by <i>yogavibhâga</span>. I am sure, Pâṇini himself has given but one rule <skt>kālā atyantasaṃyoge ca}. Patanjali’s defence (I, p. 384) is not persuasive.</p>
    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*4)</p>
    <p>I agree with BOETLINGK. and WHITNEY in explaining <skt>prāptajīvika} and the like as bahuvrîhis. Pâṇini brings them under the tatpurushas, see 2, 2, 4. Inversely such compounds as <skt>surāpīta}, <skt>māsajāta} which P. 6, 2, 170 understands as bahuvrîhis, are to be recognised as tatpurushas.</p>
    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*5)</p>
    <p>In Pâṇini’s text <skt>pūrvasadṛśasasonārtha-} <skt>artha} is of course to be construed with each of the members: <skt>pūrvārthi}, <skt>sadṛśārtha}, <skt>samārtha}, <skt>ūṇārtha}, cp. p. 92 N.</p>
    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*6)</p>
    <p>Sûtra 2, 1, 30 is ill-handled by the commentaries. They expound</p>
    <p><skt>tṛtīyā tatkṛtārthena guṇavacanena}, as <skt>tatkṛtārthena} were a dvandva = <skt>tatkṛtena} + <skt>arthena}. How they have come to this contorted interpretation I did not understand before perusing Patanjali; from him I have seen, that his very cavillations (I, 884 sq.) must have provoked it. Yet the aim of the author of our sûtra is unmistakable. He allows the instrumental to be compounded with any adjective (<skt>guṇavacanena}), which has its justification by that instrumental: <skt>tatkṛtārthena} = <skt>yasyārthastayā tṛtīyayā kṛtaḥ syātnena}. So in <skt>niḥśvāsāndha ādarśaḥ} the instance, I have quoted from the Râm., it is the exhalation that causes the mirror to be qualified a tarnished one.</p>
    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*7)</p>
    <p>These compounds are not frequent <skt>alpaśaḥ} (P. 2, 1, 38).</p>
