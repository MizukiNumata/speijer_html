          <h2>217. additions to the rules of Pâṇini thereabout.</h2>
          <small>
            <p>This list of possible kinds of tatpurushas, made up of noun-case + noun, is however not complete, as will soon appear, if one undertakes to systematize the tatpurushas occurring in fact in some literary work <a href="#216-e1">(*1)</a>. So, among others, Pâṇini does not mention the abl. of comparison, compounded with <skt>anya</skt> and <skt>itara</skt>; the instrumental + words expressive of plenty; the accus. with the participial adjectives in <skt>-u</skt>. Then, many more participles, whose former part is some noun-case, are in common use, though not necessarily, if at all, implied by the foresaid rules.</p>
            <p>1. abl. of comparison + <skt>anya</skt>, especially, if the former part be a pronoun, as Hit. 30 <skt>bhavadanyo mayā kaḥ suhṛtprāptavyaḥ</skt>, Panc. I, 12 trade is said to be the best means for making money, <skt>tadanyaḥ [sc. upāyaḥ] saṃśayātmakaḥ</skt> (any other but this is dangerous).</p>
            <p>2. abl. of compar. + <skt>itara</skt>. — Such compounds are an elegant paraphrase, while calling something: the contrary of its opposite. So <skt>dakṣiṇetara</skt> = <skt>savya</skt> »left,” <skt>sulabhetara upāyaḥ</skt> (a difficult expedient), Daç. 175 <skt>tayā navavadhvā dveṣam alpetaraṃ babandha</skt> (he bore his newly married wife a heavy grudge).</p>
            <p>3. instrum. + word expressive of plenty. Of the kind are those in <skt>-āṭhya</skt>, <skt>-pracura</skt>, <skt>-samākula</skt> etc Panc. 319 <skt>ūrṇāpracuro ’yaṃ meṣaḥ</skt>, ibid. 7 <skt>siṃhavyāghrasamākule ’sminvane</skt>.</p>
            <p>4. accus. + adjective in <skt>-u</skt> derived of a desiderative. Panc. 3 <skt>nāham arthalipsuḥ</skt>, M. 7, 197 <skt>yudhyeta jayaprepsurapetabhīḥ</skt>.</p>
            <p>5. Instances of noun-cases + participles are manifold and often met with. First, such as where the former part represents a sociative instrumental, as Panc. I, 164 <skt>saṃmānasaṃyuktāḥ sevakāḥ</skt>, ibid. I, 229 <skt>bhāryā parasaṃgatā</skt> (a wife, who holds illicit intercourse with another). — Then, such as are expressive of separation (<a href="#82">82</a>), Panc. I, 35 <skt>sevāvivarjitaḥ</skt> (abstaining from attendance), ibid. p. 1 <skt>putrā vivekarahitāḥ</skt> (sons, deprived of discernment), ibid. I, 189 <skt>saṃmānavihīnaḥ</skt>, cp. <a href="#198">198</a>. — Further locatives + <skt>sthita</skt>, <skt>gata</skt> (cp. <a href="#197">197</a>), <skt>jāta</skt>, <skt>utpanna</skt> etc., as R. 3, 31, 2 <skt>janasthānasthitā rākṣasāḥ</skt> (the râxasas, staying at Janasthāna), Panc. I, 128 <skt>sadaivāpadgato rājā bhogyo bhavati mantriṇām</skt> (when being in distress, a king is always the prey of his ministers), ibid. I, 104 <skt>mūṣikā gṛhajātāpi hantavyā</skt>, Kathâs. 42, 149 <skt>aṅghripatitaḥ</skt> (fallen at their feet). — Or the former member is a dative or loc. of purpose: Panc, I, 125 <skt>rājyalābhodhyato vṛtraḥ</skt> (Vrtra, striving for obtaining the royalty); an accusative: ibid, p 37 <skt>saṃjīvakānuraktaḥ</skt> (attached to S.); an abl. of origin: ibid. p. 2 <skt>kulaprasūtasya</skt> (of one born from a respectable family); a loc. of reference: ibid. I, 15 <skt>goṣṭhikakarmaniyuktaḥ</skt>. And so on.</p>
            <p>6. As to the compound adjectives, they may generally be said to be comprised by the rules of Pâṇini, as their former part is a genitive or may be accepted as such. Among them are to be noticed <skt>yogya</skt>, <skt>anurūpa</skt>, <skt>ucita</skt>, <skt>samartha</skt>, those of skill and ability as <skt>vicakṣaṇa</skt>, <skt>abhijña</skt>, <skt>kovit</skt>, then such as <skt>sadṛśa</skt>, <skt>sama</skt> (cp. <a href="#216">216</a>, III <i>b.</i>) Panc. 17 <skt>rājā bhṛtyānuttamapadayogyān hīnādhamasthāne niyojayati</skt>, ibid. 21 <skt>tasya ca śabdānurūpeṇa parākrameṇa bhāvyam</skt> (his strength will be in proportion to his voice), ibid. 27 <skt>bhavānvacanapaṭur dṛśyate</skt>, ibid. 13 <skt>katham ahaṃ sevānabhijñaḥ</skt>. Even indubitable dative-like genitives are compounded with the adjectives, which they qualify. Panc. p. 1 <skt>rājā tān śāstravimukhānālovya</skt> (as the king understood they were averse to the çâstras —). Panc. p. 1 affords even this instance of a tatpur., made up of a dat. of interest + subst., when calling some king <skt>sakalārthikalpadrumaḥ</skt> (v. a. a blessing for all the indigent).</p>
            <p>7. Compounds made up of a genitive + agent in <skt>-tṛ</skt>, though explicitly interdicted by Pâṇini, are in fact met with. Panc. I, 2 <skt>namo ’stu nayaśāstrakartṛbhyaḥ</skt>, ibid. p. 7 <skt>tasya maṅgalavṛṣabhau dhūrvoṭhārau sthitau</skt> (two splendid bulls drew his chariot).</p>
            <p>8. Finally we may set up a category apart for such tatpurushas, the former part of which is a noun-case, doing more or less duty of an adverb. Panc. 21 <skt>na yuktaṃ svāminaḥ pūrvopārjitaṃ vanaṃ tyaktum</skt>, here <skt>pūrvopārjita</skt> = <skt>pūrvam upārjita</skt> »acquired before,” Kathâs. 29, 82 <skt>vyājasapraṇayair vāvyair vañcyate</skt> (— is deceived by words falsely kind), Panc. 63 <skt>snehasaṃbhāṣaḥ</skt> (a friendly discourse), Mhbh. 1, 152, 34 <skt>sukhasuptānvane bhrātṝn…na bodhayiṣyāmi</skt> (I will not awake my brothers who are sleeping quietly in the forest), Kathâs. 42, 149 <skt>paryāyāliṅgitaḥ</skt> (embraced by turns). In all but the first of these examples the former part is an <i>instrumentalis modi</i>, used almost as an adverb (<a href="#77">77</a>). Cp. the following paragraph.</p>

            It would be indeed an interesting subject-matter for investigation to compare on a large scale these statements of Pâṇini with the facts offered us by tee extant Sanskrit literature.
