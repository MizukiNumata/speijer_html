    <p>222. Nature and characteristics of the bahuvrîhi.</p>
    <p>The difference between the tatpurusha and the bahuvrîhi is an essential one. The former implies no more than is purported by its consistituent elements, but the bahuvrîhi always adds something tacitly understood, generally the conception of ,,having, possessing.” [indrazatruH] when tatpurusha = [indrasya zatruH] ,,Indra’s foe,” when bahuvrîhi it means ,,having Indra for foe, one whose foe is Indra;” [sUryavarNaH], when tatp. = [sUryasya varNaH] ,,the colour of the sun,” when bahuvr. it denotes ,,one having the colour of the sun.” The bahuvrîhi, therefore, is invariably an <i>adjective</span>, referring to some substantive (*1). Pâṇini then is quite right, when he defines the bahuvrîhi as ,,a complex of elements serving to qualify some</p>
    <p>other word (*2).</p>
    <p>Like other adjectives, the bahuvrîhis may be used as adverbs, when put in the accus. of the neuter singular, see 240.</p>

    <p>By this it is however not asserted, that a bahuvrîhi cannot be used as a substantive, but only this: when used so, they are to be</p>
    <p>considered just as any other adjective, that does duty of a subst. [mahAtmA] when= »a noble-man” is to be compared with such a word as [zuciH] when meaning »an honest man” or [bAlaH] when = »boy.”</p>

    <p>P. 2, 2, 23 sq. [bahuvrIhiranekamanyapadArthe]. According to that definition, Indian grammar does by no means make restriction as to the number of the elements out of which a bahuvrîhi is made up. This is distinctly expressed in a metrical rule of the <i>Kâtantra</span> (2, 5, 9)</p>
    <p>[syAtAM yadi pade tu yadi vA syurbahUnyapi / tAnyanyasya padasyArthe bahuvrIhiH] etc.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, in analyzing even intricate bahuvrîhis it will appear that, logically, there are but two members — predicate and subject — either or both of which may be compounds themselves, even if it would not always be allowed to use such compounds by themselves as separate words. Pâṇini himself knows »a class of compounds only allowed for the sake of being used as the former part of other compounds” [P. 2, 1, 51].</p>
