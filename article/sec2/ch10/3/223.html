          <h6>Its members are to be called predicate and subject.</h6>
          <p>From a syntactic point of view, the bahuvrihi, it may be made up of three, four or more elements, does contain but <i>two</i> members, virtually identical with the subject and the predicate of a full sentence, just as the tatpurusha represents a main noun with its attribute.</p>

          <h6>The predicate precedes, the subject is the latter member.</h6>
          <p>And, as within the tatpurusha the attribute</p>
          <p>is put at the head and the main noun behind (<a href="#210">210</a>), so within the bahuvrîhi the predicate precedes, the subject is the latter member. When analyzing f. i. the bahuvrîhi [mahAvIryaH] we get the clause [yasya vIryaM mahat] ,,he whose strength is great,” similarly [sUryavarNaH] = [yasyavarNaH sUryasyeva] ,,he whose colour is like the sun’s,” [bhUtalanyastalocanaH] is an epithet of somebody, whose eyes are fixed on the earth [yasya bhUtale nyaste locane]. In these examples, the words [vIrya], [varNa], [locana] are the subjects within the bahuvrîhis, that which precedes them being the predicates.</p>

          <h6>Types of bahuvrîhis.</h6>
          <p>In treating of the tatpurushas we have distinguished between l. the karmadhârayas, 2. those the former member of which represents some noun-case, 3. where it is a particle. In an analogous way we may speak of three types of bahuvrîhis: <i>a.</i>) those, where there is grammatical concord between subject and predicate, <i>b.</i>) such, whose predicate is a noun-case, <i>c.</i>) such, where it is a particle.</p>
          <p>Type <i>a.</i> — Here the predicate is mostly an adjective or a participle, as [indrazatruH] ,,having Indra for foe.” When adjective, the bahuvrîhi has generally the worth of Latin <i>gen.</i> or <i>abl. qualitatis</i>, or <i>abl. modi</i>. So [vIrovyUDhoraskaH] — <i>heros lato pectore</i>, Panc. 62 [saraH svalpatoyam] = <i>lacus exiguae aquae</i>. When participle, the bahuvrîhi not rarely concurs with the gerund, the absolute locative and the like It may as well be said [tyaktanagaro ‘raNyAyAhaM prAtiSThe] as [nagaraM tyaktvA] or [tyakte nagare-] (I left the town and set out for the forest).</p>
          <p>Those belonging to type <i>b.</i>) are such as [azvamukhaH] (having a horse’s face), Panc. 71 [saMjIvako yuSmatpAdAnAmupari drohabuddhiH] (Sanj. meditates of doing harm to Your Majesty), here [drohabuddhiH] = [yasya drohAya (or drohe) buddhiH] ,,whose mind is to do harm.”</p>
          <p>Those belonging to type <i>c.</i>) are such as [adhomukha] (having one’s face cast down), [antaHsattva] (pregnant), [evaMprabhAvo rAjA] (a king of such a power). Very common are those, commencing by [a-], [su-], [duH-], as [aputraH] (having no sons), [suputraH] (having a good son or good sons).</p>
          <p>Type <i>a.</i>) and <i>c.</i>) are much more common than type <i>b.</i>).</p>
