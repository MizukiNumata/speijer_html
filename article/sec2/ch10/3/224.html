            <small>Examples of bahuvrîhis. Type <i>a.</i>) Nala. 1, 5 <skt>tathaivāsīd vidarbheṣu bhīmo bhīmaparākramaḥ</skt>. R. 3, 16, 11 <skt>mṛdusūryāḥ paṭuśītāḥ… divasā bhānti sāṃpratam</skt> (now the days are appearing with a mild sun, m11ch fog and a sharp cold). Hit. 90 <skt>asau pāpāśayaḥ</skt> (he is of a wicked disposition). Panc. 150 <skt>tena [sc. kroḍena]… daṃṣṭrāgreṇa pāṭitodaraḥ pulindo gatāsurbhūtale ‘patat</skt> (the Pulinda fell down <i>lifeless</i> on the earth, <i>having his belly split up</i> by the edge of the teeth of the boar). Mâlav. I, p. 14 <skt>rājā / anuvācitalekham amātyaṃ vilobya</skt> (as the minister <i>has finished his lecture of the letter</i>, the king looks on him). Panc. 71 <skt>saṃdahyamānahṛdayaḥ svayam evābhyāgato vaktum</skt> (<i>as it stung my mind</i>, I myself am come to tell you of it).</small>

            <small>Nothing impedes, of course, both the subject and the predicate being concordant substantives. Bhoj. 17 <skt>rājānaḥ kośabalā eva vijayino nānye</skt> (no other kings are successful in their wars but those, whose power is a treasury), Panc. 185 <skt>tatra vāyasarājo’nekakākaparivāraḥ prativasati sva</skt> [the bahuvr. = <skt>yasyāneke kākāḥ parivāraḥ</skt> »whose attendance are many crows”], Daç, 82 <skt>aryavaryaḥ kuberadattanāmā</skt> (a great merchant, whose name is Kub.), R. 3, 19, 22 <skt>mānuṣau cīrakṛṣṇājināmbarau</skt>.</small>

          <p class="rem" id="224-rem-1-e">Rem. 1. In such bahuvrîhis, as have an adjective behind, that adjective does duty of a subst. So f. i. Çâk. I <skt>abhirūpabhūyiṣṭhā pariṣat</skt> (the assembly is for the greater part made up of distinguished people) here the bahuvr. = <skt>yasyā abhirūpā bhūyiṣṭhāḥ</skt> »most of which are <skt>abhirūpāḥ</skt>,” Mâlat. I, p. 2 <skt>uditabhūyiṣṭha eṣa bhagavāntapanaḥ</skt> »the sun has almost risen,” R. 2, 40, 17 <skt>sītātṛtīyān ārūḍhān dṛṣṭvā</skt> (— saw them mounted, having Sîtâ as the third), R. 3, 55, 15 <skt>sahasram ekaṃ mama kāryapuraḥsaram</skt> (thousand men whose <i>main object</i> [<skt>puruḥsaram</skt>] it is to carry out my orders).</p>
          <p class="rem" id="224-rem-2-e">Rem. 2. A proper kind of bahuvrîhis are such as <skt>asikara</skt> (having a sword in one’s hand), <skt>aśrukaṇṭha</skt> (sobbing, liter. »one having tears in his throat”) . In analyzing them, the latter part turns out a locative, for <skt>asikaraḥ</skt> = <skt>yasyāsiḥ kare sa</skt> and <skt>aśrukaṇaṭhaḥ</skt> = <skt>yasyāśrūṇi kaṇṭhe sa</skt>. For the rest, we have here no exception to the general rule on the arrangement of the two members of a bahuvrîhi. It is <skt>asi</skt> and <skt>aśru</skt> which are predicated, not <skt>kare</skt> nor <skt>kaṇṭhe</skt>, for the intention is to say not that Mr. so and so has a hand or a throat, but what it is, he keeps within (*1). R. 3, 51, 9 Sîtâ has the epithet <skt>bāṣpalocanā</skt> »having tears in her eyes.” Comp. <scap>Whitney</scap> § 1303.</p>
          <p class="rem" id="224-rem-3-e">Rem. 3. In some bahuvrîhis the order of the members is optional. {P. 2, 3, 37.} One may say promiscuously <skt>āhitāgniḥ</skt> and <skt>agnyāhitaḥ</skt> (one who keeps the holy fires), <skt>jātaputraḥ</skt> or <skt>putrajātaḥ</skt> (one having children). Of the kind are <skt>dantajāta</skt> or <skt>jātadanta</skt>, see M. 5, 58 with Kull., <skt>guDapriya</skt> and <skt>priyaguḍa</skt> (fond of sweetmeats) (*2), R. 2, 119, 5 <skt>munayaḥ kalaśodyatāḥ</skt> (hermits with uplifted pitchers). Participles in <skt>-ta</skt> must be put behind, if the predicate be a weapon, therefore <skt>asyudyataḥ</skt> (with uplifted sword), see vârtt. on P. 2, 2, 36.</p>
          <p class="rem" id="224-rem-4-e">Rem. 4. The type a.) of the bahuvrîhi in its outer form is often identical with a karmadhâraya, for the discrepancies in the accentuation are not heeded. In practice, one avoids to use as bahuvrîhis such compounds as are wont to be karmadhârayas, as <skt>sarvajana</skt>, <skt>maharṣi</skt>, <skt>kalarava</skt>, and inversely such as <skt>mahābāhu</skt>, <skt>bahuśruta</skt>, <skt>kṛtakārya</skt> will not have to be otherwise accepted than as bahuvrîhis (*3). Yet, it often is only the context which will enable the reader how to accept a given compound.</p>

            Cp. vârtt. 4 of Pat. on P. 2, 2, 86.

            As to <skt>priya</skt>, Pat. vârtt. 2 on P. 2, 2, 85 teaches the option. But it seems better to explain <skt>guḍapriya</skt> as being a tatpursha, because 1st <skt>priya</skt> may be not only = »beloved,” but also = »loving,” see Petr. Dict. IV, p. 1161 <i>s. v.</i> 1 c), 2ly as Pâṇini somewhere else <skt>P. 6, 2, 15 sq.</skt> mentions some <i>tatpurusha</i>, in <skt>-prati</skt>. The same may apply to some of the participles in <skt>-ta</skt>, if not to all. Since <skt>pīta</skt> may sometimes have an active signification and sometimes a passive one, it is plain we are allowed to compound as well the tatpurusha <skt>kṣīrapītaḥ</skt> = <i>lac potus</i>, as the bahuvr. <skt>pītakṣīraḥ</skt> = <i>lacte poto</i>. Comp. what has been said p. 157 N. 2. [<a href="#216-e4">216-(*4)</a>]<br />
            Panc. 283 affords a specimen of a kind of compounds, in which two types are confounded: <skt>kācic chṛgālikā māṃsapiṇḍagṛhītavadanā</skt>, here the author seems to have blended promiscuously two bahuvrîhis <skt>māṃsapiṇḍavadanā</skt> and <skt>gṛhītamāṃsapiṇḍā</skt>, either of which would have sufficed. Comp. Hariv. 5814 <skt>cakrodyakara</skt>.
