    <p>231. Case-nouns standing outside the compound, that to be construed with it.</p>

    <p><<b>>Case-nouns standing outside the compound</span> are very often to be construed with it or with one of its members. This is but consistent with the whole spirit, which pervades Sanskrit composition. A great liberty is left to the speaker to prefer either a rather synthetical or a rather analytical mode of expression. He has the opportunity of enlarging compounds by making enter within them any noun or adverb serving to qualify the whole or any part of it. But on the other hand nothing compels him to do so. The qualifying noun may as well be a self-existent word having its own noun-case. (*1) So Çâk. V <skt>himavato girer upatyakAraNyavAsinaH} (dwelling in the forests on the slope of mount Himavân), here <skt>himavato gireH} stands outside the compound as to its form, but belongs to it by its meaning, as it qualifies the member <skt>upatyakA}.</p>

    <p>Panc. 42 a weaver returns home to his wife, <skt>prAgeva karNaparaMparayA tasyAH zrutApavAdaH} »having heard evil report on her account;’’ when using a mere analytical expression, the author of the Pancatantra would have said <skt>tasyA apavAdaM zrutvA} or <skt>zrute tasyA apavAde} etc., when a mere synthetical one <skt>zrutatadapavAdaH}, but he has here availed himself of a mixed idiom. — Mâlav. V, p. 140 <skt>sagaraH pautreNa pratyAhRtAzvaH} (S., who had the horse brought back by his grand-son); Kumâras.I, 37 <skt>etAvatA nanvanumeyazobhi…[asyA] aGkam}, here <skt>etAvatA} qualifies <skt>anumeya} the former member of the compound; Mahâv. I, p. 6 <skt>prakRtyA puNyalakSmIkau kAveta}, here <skt>prakRtyA} also is intimately connected with the compound. These few examples will suffice, as the idiom is met with on almost every page of Sanskrit.</p>

    <p>I wonder, what reasons may have induced WHITNEY (§ 1316) to speak of this idiom as something irregular. On the contrary, nothing can be more regular.</p>
