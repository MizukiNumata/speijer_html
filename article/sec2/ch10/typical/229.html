          <h2>229.</h2>

          <p>To give a fuller account of them, we will treat of them separately.</p>

          <h6>1. <skt>-ādi</skt> etc.</h6>
          <p>1. Those in <skt>-ādi</skt>, <skt>-ādika</skt>, <skt>-ādya</skt>, <skt>-prabhṛti</skt> are babuvrîhis, meaning properly „the beginning of which is —,” as is still plain f. i. in M. 1, 50 <skt>etadantās tu gatayo brahmādyāḥ</skt> (the existences, at the head of which stands Brahmâ, end here). Commonly they are expressive of »etc.; and the like.” Panc. 8 <skt>tasyaurdhvadehikakriyā vṛṣotsargādikāḥ sarvāścakāra</skt> (be performed in his honour all the funeral rites, viz. the vṛshotsarga etc.), Hit. 123 <skt>suvarṇavastrādi prasādadānaṃ kriyatām</skt> (bestow on them presents of the king’s favour, gold, clothes and so on), Panc. 62 <skt>sarve matsyakacchapaprabhṛtayastaṃ papracchuḥ</skt> (all [aquatic animals], fishes, tortoises etc. —). In these examples the compounds are adjectives, but often they are used as substantives too [see note 1 on p. 165 (222)], as Bhoj. 64 <skt>aham api brāhmaṇaputraḥ / tvāmatra śayānaṃ vīkṣya kamaṇḍalūpavītādibhir brāhmaṇaṃ jñātvā bhavadāstarāsanna evāhaṃ prasuptaḥ</skt>, Panc. 27 <skt>adyaprabhṛti prasādanigrahādikaṃ tvayaiva kāryam</skt> (from to-day it is you by whom favour, punishment, etc. are to be administered.)</p>

          <h6>2. <skt>-pūrva</skt>, <skt>-puraḥsara</skt></h6>
          <p>2. When adjectives, those in <skt>-pūrva</skt> and <skt>-puraḥsara</skt> may have the same purport as those in <skt>-ādi</skt> etc. Panc. 20 <skt>vyāghradvīpivṛkapuraḥsarāḥ sarve</skt> (all of them, tigers, panters, wolves and the rest). When adverbs, the latter member is almost meaningless: <skt>prītipūrvaṃ bhāṣate</skt> = <skt>saprīti bhāṣate</skt>, Hit. 7 <skt>tasya bahumānapuraḥsaraṃ putrān samarpitavān</skt> (respectfully he gave over his sons to him).</p>

          <h6>3. <skt>bhūtapūrva</skt> and the like.</h6>
          <p>3. Those in <skt>pUrva</skt> may also signify »having been <i>formerly</i> so and so,’’ but now being so no more: <skt>āḍhyapūrvaḥ</skt> „one who onoe has been rich,’’ <skt>bhūtapūrvaḥ</skt> (of old). N. 1, 13 <skt>na kvacid dṛṣṭapūrvā</skt> (never seen before), Çâk, VI <skt>satyamūḍhapūrvā tatrabhavatī rahasi śakuntalā</skt> (indeed, I once have wedded secretly the Lady Çak.) (*1).</p>

          <h6>4. <skt>-mātram</skt></h6>
          <p>4. <i>a.</i>) Compounds in <skt>-mātram</skt> are bahuvrîhis, used as substantives of the neuter, and properly have the meaning »the exact measure (<skt>mātrā</skt>) of which is —.’’ Yet, as a rule they are used as if their latter member were some limitative particle and <skt>-mātram</skt> may be translated by »but, only.’’ Prabodh. I, p. 13 <skt>kiṃ vadantīmātram etat</skt> (it is but a vain rumour), Panc. 192 <skt>ko’pi te vāṅmātreṇāpi sahāya tvaṃ na kariṣyati</skt> (nobody will make you his friend only on account of your voice), R. 3, 71, 22 <skt>nāmamātraṃ tu jānāmi na rūpaṃ tasya rakṣasaḥ</skt>. This translation, however, does not suit all instances. Sometimes <skt>-mātram</skt> signifies, that the whole class is meant, not single individuals belonging to it. Pat. I, p. 242 <skt>brāhmaṇo na hantavyaḥ surā na peyeti brāhmaṇamātraṃ na hanyate surāmātraṃ ca na pīyate</skt> (since it is said: »one may not hurt a brahman, nor drink strong liquor’’, one does not hurt anybody, that is named brahman, nor drinks anything; to which the appellation »strong liquor’’ is applicable). Comm. on R. 2, 12, 100 <skt>kaikeyīdaurjanyaṃ dṛṣṭvā rājā śokena strīmātraṃ nindati</skt> (the king seeing the foul conduct of K., by his sorrow chides the whole feminine sex).</p>

          <h6><skt>-jātam</skt></h6>
          <p>— In this meaning <skt>-jātam</skt> is almost synonymous, as Daç. 22 <skt>cauḍopanayanādisaṃskārajātam alabhta</skt> (he obtained the cauda, the upanayana, in short the whole set of sacraments), Bhoj. 62 <skt>akhileṣvapikośeṣu yadvittajātam asti tatsarvaṃ devena kavibhyo dattam</skt>.</p>

          <h6><i>b</i>) Adjectt. in <skt>mātra</skt>.</h6>
          <p><i>b.</i>) <skt>mātra</skt> is also put to participles; then it is an adjective and signifies »as soon as —.’’ Panc. III, 3 <skt>jātamātraṃ śatruṃ praśamaṃ nayet</skt> (one must abate a foe, as soon as he has arisen), ibid. p. 58 <skt>bhagavatā nārāyaṇena smṛtamātro vainateyaḥ saṃprāptaḥ</skt>, Kathâs. 36, 111, etc.</p>
          <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. The adjectival employment of those in <skt>-mātra</skt> is however not restricted to the case that the former member is a participle. See but Panc. II, 95 <skt>nāmamātrā na siddhau hi dhanahīnāḥ…narāḥ</skt> (poor people do but bear the name of men, as they are of no use whatsoever).</p>

          <h6>5. <skt>-kalpa</skt>, <skt>-deśīya</skt>, <skt>-prāya</skt>.</h6>
          <p>5. »Almost, nearly, like’’ is signified by <skt>-kalpa</skt>, <skt>-dezya</skt>, <skt>-deśīya</skt>, <skt>-prāya</skt>, which have almost got the nature of pure formal suffixes, and, indeed, the former three are taught as such by Pâṇini (5, 3, 67). Of them, those in <skt>-kalpa</skt> and <skt>-prāya</skt> are the most frequent. R. 3, 16, 39 <skt>vākyāny amṛtakalpāni</skt> (speech like ambrosia), Kumâras. 3, 14 <skt>kāryaṃ tvayā naḥ pratipannakalpam</skt> (you have nearly engaged yourself to do our affair), Kathâs. 6, 51 <skt>chandogaḥ kaścid ity ukto viṭaprāyeṇa kenacit</skt> (some Sâmavedin was thus addressed by somebody like a rake), Mâlat. IX, p. 149 <skt>evaṃ paryavasitaprāyaiva naḥ pratyāśā</skt> (in this manner all my hope is almost gone), Panc. 202 <skt>pakvaśāliprāyaṃ deśaṃ gataḥ</skt> (gone to a country, where a good deal of the paddy was ripe), Daç. 78 <skt>vipralambhaprāyam idam adharmavartma</skt> (this way of unrighteousneas, full of deception). Those in <skt>-prāya</skt> are, indeed, bahuvrîhis, to be analyzed thus: »the greater part of which is —,’’ just aa those in <skt>-kalpa</skt> properly are = »the manner or mode of which is —.’’</p>

          <h6>6. <skt>-rūpa</skt>.</h6>
          <p>6. T.hose in <skt>-rūpa</skt> are likewise adjectives. As <skt>-rūpa</skt> means not only »shape, form’’ in general, but also »a beautiful shape, a beauty,’’ so the bahuvrîhis ending in it admit of either acoeptation. Pâṇini (5, 3, 66) mentions the latter, when teaching such compounds as <skt>brāhmaṇarūpaḥ</skt>, <skt>pacatirūpam</skt> to be praise-denoting. (*2) But, in practice, those in <skt>-rūpa</skt> are not often met with in this meaning, by far oftener they are employed for the sake of qualifying some general kind by describing its species. Then we may often translate them by means of »f. i.; viz.’’ Instances are chiefly found in commentaries and the like. Sây. on Ait. Br. 2, 37, 1 [p. 272 ed. Aufrecht] <skt>rathabhaṅgarūpo vyāmohaḥ</skt>.</p>

          <h6>7. <skt>-avadhi</skt>.</h6>
          <p>7. Bahuvrîhis in <skt>-avadhi</skt> (limit) may be synonymous of <skt>yāvat</skt> in both of its acceptations (169 with Rem.). See f. i. Kathâs. 4, 100 <skt>pratyāgamāvadhi</skt> (till I shall have come back); 52, 146.</p>

          <h6>8. <skt>-viśeṣa</skt>.</h6>
          <p>8. Tatpurushas in <skt>-viśeṣa</skt>, when meaning »excellent species,’’ are expressive of something »first-rate, excellent.’’ See f. i. Ragh. 2, 7.</p>

          <h6>9. <skt>-antaram</skt>.</h6>
          <p>9. Tatpurushas in <skt>-antaram</skt> are often to be rendered by »some’’ or »other.’’ Properly speaking, <skt>antaram</skt>, <skt>viśeṣaḥ</skt> and <skt>bhedaḥ</skt> mean variety, species,’’ and as a »variety of something’’ is »something different’’, the transition of meaning may easily be accounted for. — Mâlav. III, p. 60 <skt>pūrvasmādavasthāntaram upārūṭhā tatrabhavatī</skt> (v. a. the lady has changed her former attitude to another), Panc. I, 132 <skt>śubhāśubhaphalaṃ sadyo nṛpād daivād bhavāntare</skt> (the fruit of good and evil deeds comes instantly, when from the king, but in some other existence, when from Destiny), ibid. p. 83 <skt>laghunām api durjanānāṃ madhye vastuṃ na śakyate / upāyāntaraṃ vidhāya te nūnaṃ ghnanti</skt> (one cannot dwell among wicked people, for they will hurt you by some means or other). The proper meaning of <skt>-antaram</skt> is not rarely transparent, as in the example quoted first. Likewise Panc. 248 <skt>bhartānyamārgāntareṇāgatya</skt>, Panc. 205 <skt>yuvayorbhāṣyāntaraṃ samyaṅ na śṛṇomi</skt> (I do not hear distinctly, of what kind of things you speak).</p>

          <h6>10. <skt>-vidhiḥ</skt>.</h6>
          <p>10. Tatpurushas in <skt>-vidhiḥ</skt> may denote, that the action spoken of is done »in due form.’’ Panc. I, 335 <skt>pradānavidhinā… saṃprāpyate phalam</skt>, Daç. 80 <skt>tadagāre ‘tyudārambhyavahāravidhimakaravam</skt> (in his house I gave a stylish dinner).</p>
          <p>This list may be easily enlarged.</p>

          <p id="229-e1" class="note">
            (*1)<br />
            One is wont to analyze <skt>bhūtapūrvaḥ</skt> by <skt>pūrvaṃ bhūtaḥ</skt> and so on, see f. i. Kâç. on P. 5, 3, 53, but that analysis does not give a satisfactory account of the nature of the compound. It the adverb <skt>pūrvaṃ</skt> were compounded with the noun <skt>bhūta</skt>, one would expect <skt>pūrvabhūta</skt> in the same way, as f. i. M. 9, 267 <skt>pūrvataskarāḥ</skt> »people who have formerly been thieves.’’
          </p>

          <p id="229-e2" class="note">
            (*2)<br />
            Pâṇini speaks of <skt>-rūpa</skt> as of a taddhita. Kâç. when commenting on our sûtra shows <skt>-rūpa</skt> to be used to signify the highest pitch of a quality, as <skt>vṛṣalarūpo’yaṃ palāṇḍunā surāṃ pibati</skt>. Blame, inversely, is expressed by compounds in <skt>-pāśa</skt> (P. 5, 3, 47), as in this verse of Bhojapr. (p. 7) <skt>svāmy ukte yo na yatate sa bhṛtyo bhṛyapāśakaḥ</skt> (the attendant, who does not exert himself, when ordered hy his master, is a bad attendaut).
