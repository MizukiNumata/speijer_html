      <h2>86. Old datives.</h2>

      <p>It is likely, that the genitive had not encroached so much on the dative’s sphere of employment in the dialect of the brâhmanas and of ancient epic poetry, as afterwards. In some instances the dative is no more used in the classical language, after having been employed so in the archaic dialect.</p>
      <p>
        <small>Of the kind are <i>a</i>.) the dative of the agent of kṛtyas. It seems to be restricted to the oldest dialect, that of the vedic mantras. Rgv. I, 31, 5 <skt>udhyatas ruce bhavati śravāyyaḥ</skt> (you are worshipful to him who holds the spoon uplifted). Cp. <sCap>Delbr</sCap>.’s monography, p. 90.</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        <small><i>b</i>.) the dative with the adjectives of friendship and the contrary. Rgv. 7, 36, 5 <skt>idaṃ namo rudrāya preṣṭham</skt>. The classic construction is here gen. or locative. See Delbr. 1. 1. p. 90.</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        <small><i>c</i>.) the dative with <skt>śraddhā</skt> (to have faith, to trust), <skt>śru</skt> (to listen), see Delbr. 1. 1. p. 84.</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        <small>In classic Sanskrit the person trusted is put in the gen. or loc., the thing believed in the ace, and when = »to approve” or »to welcome,” <skt>śraddhā</skt> is of course a transitive, as Kathâs. 5, 114; 46, 136. On the classic construction of <skt>śru</skt> see 95, 4-, 126 b). Its desiderative <skt>śuśrūṣate</skt> (to listen) is construed with a dai in the Chândogya Upanishad (7, 5, 2) <skt>tasmai śuśrūṣante</skt>, but in classic Sanskrit it is mostly a transitive, even when meaning <i>to obey</i>, Çâk. IV <skt>śuśrūṣasva</skt>.</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        <small><i>d</i>.) a dative with substantives, to denote <i>the possessor</i>, cp. English »a son <i>to</i> me.” Rgv. 1, 31, 2 <skt>vibhur viśvasmai bhuvanāya</skt> (ruler of the whole universe); Ch. Up. 4, 3, 6 <skt>yasmai vā etad annaṃ tasmā etan na dattam</skt> (you have not given the food to him, to whom it belongs). — This construction has long subsisted in the case of the possessor being a personal pronoun, especially in epic poetry. Mhbh. 1, 51, 5 <skt>pitā mahyam</skt>, R. 1, 54, 11 <skt>balaṃ mahyam</skt> instead of <skt>mama</skt>; Mhbh. 1, 151, 39 <skt>nānujñāṃ me yudhiṣṭhiraḥ prayacchati vadhe tubhyam</skt> (Yudh. refuses me the permission of killing you), ibid. 1, 111, 14 <skt>darśanaṃ mahyam</skt>, R. 1, 13, 4; 2, 32, 8, etc.</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        <small>NB. In the brâhmana-works it is sometimes impossible to decide whether a dative or a genitive has been employed. Both cases may formally coincide in the singular of the feminines in <skt>-ā</skt>, <skt>-ri</skt>, <skt>-ū</skt> (<skt>-i</skt>, <skt>-u</skt>). In the dialect of these books the gen. and abl. of fhe singular may end in <skt>-ai</skt>, just as the dative does; <skt>sriyai</skt> in the brâhmana-works = classic <skt>striyai</skt> or <skt>striyāḥ</skt>. See <sCap>Kuhn</sCap>, <i>Zeitschr</i>. XV, p. 420 sqq., <sCap>Aufrecht</sCap> p. 428 of his edition of the Aitareyabrâhmana.</small>
