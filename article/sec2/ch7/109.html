      <h2>109. General view of the genitive.</h2>

      <p>The fundamental notion of the genitive or sixth case is to mark the <i>belonging to</i>, <i>partaking of</i>. In Sanskrit, it is employed in so manifold and so different ways as to make it very difficult to give a satisfactory account of all of them <a href="#109-e1">(*1)</a>. — The absolute genitive will be treated in the chapter on participles.</p>

      <p id="109-e1" type="note">
        (*1) <br />
        Kâç. on P. 1, 1, 49 <skt>bahavo hi ṣaṣṭhyarthāḥ svasvāmy-anantarasamīpa-samūhavikārāvayavādyāḥ</skt>. — Pâṇini seems to have not sharply defined the genitive’s sphere of employment, at least if we explain his sûtra (2, 3, 50) <skt>ṣaṣṭhī śeṣe</skt> with the Kâç. as meaning »<i>in all other instances</i> [namely if none of the other cases, taught 2, 3, 1-49, be available], one should use the sixth case.” But then it is strange, P. has not said inversely <skt>śeṣe ṣaṣṭhī</skt> (cp. his constant use 1, 4, 7; 1, 4, 108; 2, 2, 23; 3, 3, 151; 7, 2, 90). Now, Patanjali gives a somewhat different explication (I, p. 463) <skt>karmādīnām avivakṣā śeṣeḥ</skt> »the sixth case is required, if the categories object and the rest are not to be distinctly expressed” but tacitly implied. I am rather inclined to suppose, that either in framing that sûtra Pâṇini had in view his definition of the employment of the nominative, which immediately precedes; then <skt>śeṣe</skt> would be said in opposition to the <skt>prātipadika… mātre</skt> of s. 46 (note on <a href="#38">38</a>) and mean »something else, apart from the gender and number of the conception, signified by the prâtipadika”, <i>or</i> <skt>śeṣe</skt> may mean »accessory” (see Petr. Dict. <i>s. v.</i> 1, b); then the sûtra enjoins the use of the genitive if the conception, signified by the prâtipadika, is accessory of some other conception. But, which of these acceptations should prove the correct one, the intrusion of the term <skt>śeṣe</skt> in the following sûtras (51, etc), as is done by Kâç. and others, is to be blamed.
