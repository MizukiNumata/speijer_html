      <h2>111.</h2>

      <p>When pointing out the genitive as the case to put in such substantives as are wanted to qualify other substantives, it is by no means said that no other construction may be used for the same purpose. Verbal nouns often retain the verbal construction. So, if a moving to or from some place is to be expressed, nouns must be construed just as verbs; it is said <skt>purāt pravāsanam</skt>, <skt>puraṃ gamanam</skt> not <skt>purasya</skt>. Cp. Rem. on 41.</p>
      <p>Thus we meet with instrumentals as <skt>viyogo bhavādṛśaiḥ</skt> »the separation from men as you are,” <skt>kanyayā śokaḥ</skt> » sorrow on account of a girl;” — ablatives as <skt>patanāḍ ayam</skt> »fear of falling;” — datives as <skt>yūpāya dāru</skt> »wood for a stake,” <skt>samayo yaivarājyāya</skt> »the fit time for being heir-apparent;” — locatives as <skt>viṣayeṣu saṅgaḥ</skt> » attachment to the world, worldliness;” — prepositions as <skt>māṃ prati kopaḥ</skt> »anger towards me,” <skt>tasyopari pakṣapātaḥ</skt> »partiality for his sake,” <skt>samaṃ śaktimatā yuddham</skt> »a contention with a mighty one.”</p>
      <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Pāṇini has a special rule about the nouns <skt>īśvara</skt> (lord), <skt>svāmin</skt> (owner), <skt>adhipati</skt> (chief), <skt>dāyāda</skt> (heir), <skt>sākṣi</skt> (witness), <skt>pratibhū</skt> (bail) and <skt>prasūta</skt> (born) as agreeing with a locative as well as with a gen. {P. 2, 3, 39.} So <skt>gavāṃ svāmī</skt> or <skt>goṣu</skt>; cp. Kathâs. 18, 144 <skt>tvam asmākaṃ svāmī</skt> with ibid. 6, 166 <skt>svāmī viṣaye</skt>. So Mrcch. X, p. 384 <skt>pṛthivyāṃ sarvavihāreṣu kulapatir ayaṃ kriyatām</skt> (let he be appointed prior of all the monasteries of the land).</p>
