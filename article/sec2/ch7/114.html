      <h2>114. Subjective genitive.</h2>

      <p>
        The <b>subjective genitive</b> is interchangeable with the instrumental of the agent (<a href="#66">66</a>). {P. 2, 3, 66.} According to Pāṇini, the latter is <i>necessary</i>, if the verbal noun be attended by its subject and its object at the same time. In this manner two genitives are avoided, as <skt>gavāṃ doho gopena</skt> [not <skt>gopasya</skt>] (the milking of the cows by the cow-herd). We may fairly extend this observation, it seems, to all such instances, as where the subjective genitive would be used together with some other sixth case. <small>R. 3, 6, 23 <skt>viprakāram apākraṣṭuṃ rākṣasair bhavatām imam</skt> (in order to put and end to the harm caused to you by the râxasas), Mâl. VIII, p. 133 <skt>ekākino bahubhir abhiyogaḥ</skt> <a href="#114-e1">(*1)</a>; Mhbh. 1, 145, 17 <skt>yadā… kāryam asmākaṃ bhavaḍir upapatsayate</skt> (if there will occur something to do by you for us) [not <skt>kāryam asmākaṃ bhavatām</skt>, an accumulation of gen. subj. and commodi];</small>
      </p>
      <p class="rem" id="114-rem-e">Rem. Some vârttikas on this sûtra of Pāṇini contest the exactness of it. With some kṛts the subjective genitive is said to be obligatory, even when being used together with an objective genitive, as <skt>cikīrṣā viṣṇumitrasya kaṭasya</skt> (V.’s desire of making a mat). According to some, the gen. of the agent is nowhere forbidden.</p>

        (*1) <br />
        But Mudr. I, p. 49 <skt>na marṣayiṣyati rākṣasakalatrapracchādanaṃ bhavataḥ</skt>, for here nothing impedes using the genitive of the agent, the other being avoided by compounding.
