      <h2>117.</h2>

      <p>Some turns, relating to the partitive construction, are to be noticed :</p>
      <p>1. option between two things is variously expressed:</p>
      <p><i>a.</i>) both are put in the gen. M. 7, 53 [vyasanasya ca mṛtyośca vyasanaṃ kaṣṭamucyate] (liter. »of both vice and death, vice is called the worse”).</p>
      <p><i>b.</i>) both are put in the abl. Mrcch. I, p. 18 [dāridyrānmaraṇādvā maraṇaṃ mama rocate na dāidyram] (v. a. I prefer death to poverty).</p>
      <p><i>c.</i>) both are nominatives. Mhbh. 1 , 161, 6 [brahmavadhyātmavadhyā vā śreyānātmavadho mama] (v. a. I hold suicide to be preferable to the killing a brahman).</p>
      <p>Note the standing prolixity of such phrases.</p>
      <p>2. Of a partitive gen., depending on some word not expressed, there are some instances. Âçv. Grhy. 4, 4, 11 [ādiyasya vā dṛśyamāne praviśeyuḥ] (or they must enter [the village] while there is still visible ever so a little part of the sun), Kâç, on P. 2, 1, 8 [yāvadamatraṃ brāhmaṇānāmāmantrayasva] (invite of the brahmans according to the number of vessels). The partitive gen., that attends verbs (119), may be explained in this way.</p>
      <p>3. One, two, three times a day, a week, etc. is expressed »by the partitive gen., as M. 3, 281 [śrāddhaṃ trirabdasya nirvapet], Par. Grhy. 1, 3, 31 [asakṛtsaṃvatsarasya]. Likewise M. 5, 21 [saṃvatsarasyaikamapi caretkṛcchraṃ dvijottamaḥ] (a pious twice-born man should perform at least one »strong penance” a year). {P. 2, 3, 64.}</p>
      <p>4. A partitive gen., depending on the neuter of an adjective, is rare, even in the old language. Ait. Br. 2, 15, 8 [mahati rātryāḥ]. In the Rgvedasanhitâ there are even such gen. as [idā ahnaḥ], [prātarahnaḥ], which remind of Lat. <i>id temporis</i> and the like; cp. Siecke p. 65.</p>
