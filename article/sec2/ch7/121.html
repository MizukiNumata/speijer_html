        <small>4. In the archaic dialect many more verbs may be construed with the gen. of their object. Pâṇini prescribes its being lised with <i>a.</i>) <i>all</i> verbs of remembering <a href="#121-e1">(*1)</a>; <i>b.</i>) <skt>nāth</skt> when = »to desire, to hope,” cp. <a href="#120">120</a>, <i>d</i>; <i>c.</i>) five verbs of injuring viz. <skt>jāsayati</skt>, <skt>nāṭ</skt>, <skt>niprahan</skt>, <skt>krath</skt>, <skt>piṣ</skt>, <i>d.</i>) the verbs of <i>illness</i> — fever excepted — as <skt>caurasya rujati</skt>. {P. 2, 3, 56; 57.} As he does not add that the gen. with them is restricted to the holy texts, it is likely, that it was used so in his days, but that it has antiquated afterwards. <sCap>Siecke</sCap> p. 50-52 of his treatise on the vedic genitive has given some examples of its being used in the Ṛigvedasanhitâ with such verbs as <skt>adhī</skt>, <skt>adhigā</skt>, <skt>cit</skt>, <skt>man</skt> etc. With <skt>vid</skt> (to know; to be aware of, to experience) it often occurs in the brahmana-works. Ait. Br. 2, 39, 11 <skt>prāṇo vai jātavedāḥ sa hi jātānāṃ veda</skt>. As to the foresaid verbs of injuring, in the Râmâyana also (to touch) is construed with a gen., 2, 75, 31 <skt>gavāṃ spṛśatu pādena</skt> likewise 3, 66, 60 <a href="#121-e2">(*2)</a>.</small>

      <p class="rem" id="121-rem-e">Rem. According to P. 2, 3, 51 the verb is construed with the gen. of the instrument (<i>karaṇa</i>), then <skt>jñā</skt> must not be equivalent with Kâç. gives this example <skt>sarpiṣo jānīte</skt> = <skt>sarpiṣā karaṇena pravartate</skt>. It is not sufficiently plain, what is here the meaning of <skt>jñā</skt> <a href="#121-e3">(*3)</a>.</p>

      <p>Pāṇini (2, 3, 52) speaks of <skt>adhīgartha</skt>, that is »all, which mean to <i>think of</i>." In classic Sanskrit I greatly doubt instances will be found of any other verb but <skt>smṛ</skt>.</p>

      <p>Cp. the Greek <i>τνγχάνειν</i>, <i>θιγγάνειν</i> and aim. For the rest, objective genitives with verbs of <i>touching</i>, <i>desiring</i>, <i>remembering</i> are common to the whole Indo-germanic family and the most probable explication, which may be given of them is to consider them as having had at the outset the character of <i>partitive</i> genitives. Their fate has been the same in Sanskrit as in its sister-tongues. In the ancient literature they are relatively common; but gradually they decrease by time both in frequency and in extent, and modern Sanskrit has but retained a few remnants of that old and once widely-spread idiom.</p>

      <p>So the Kâçikâ. It proffers also a different explication, according to which <skt>jñā</skt> with gen. = »to ween, to fancy,” for <skt>mithyājñānam ajñānam eva</skt>. Patanjali has not expounded the sûtra. For the rest, as it runs thus <skt>jño ‘vidarthasya karaṇe</skt>, nothing impedes reading it rather <skt>jño vidarthasya karaṇe</skt>. Then it is said just the contrary : <skt>jñā</skt> when = <skt>vid</skt> complies with a gen. and in fact, in the ancient dialect <skt>jñā</skt> was not rarely construed so.</p>
