      <h2>124. Genitive with adjectives.</h2>

      <p>III. A genitive with adjectives is frequently used. When attending adjectives akin to transitive verbs, it is an objective gen., as Kathâs. 29, 55 <skt>jarā vināśinyasya tūpasya</skt> (old age, which will destroy this beauty). Among them are to be especially noticed:</p>
      <p>
        1. Those of <i>knowledge</i>, <i>skill</i>, <i>experience</i> and the contrary (as <skt>abhijña</skt>, <skt>anabhijña</skt>, <skt>kovid</skt>) and <skt>ucita</skt> (<i>wont to</i>). <small>Mudr. I, p. 34 <skt>sādhu vatsa / abhijñaḥ khalvasi lokavyavahārāṇāṃ</skt> (bravo, my child, you are well acquainted with the practice of the world), R. 1, 20, 24 <skt>saṃgrāmāṇām akovidaḥ</skt> (not skilled in battles); — R. 2, 51, 3 <skt>ucito janaḥ keśānām</skt> (people who are accustomed to trouble).</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        <small>Examples with others: Mudr. IV, p. 146 <skt>asahā bharasya</skt> (impatient of the burden), Kâm. 3, 22 <skt>hlādinīṃ sarvasatvānām</skt> (he must speak so as to rejoice all beings).</small>
      </p>
      <p>NB. With the adjectives of <i>knowledge</i> and <i>skill</i> and with some others the locative is also used (<a href="#142">142</a>). <a href="#124-e1">(*1)</a> {P. 2, 3, 40.}</p>
      <p>
        2. <skt>āyatta</skt> (depending on) and <skt>sakta</skt> (clinging to). <small>Panc. 231 <skt>tavāyattaḥ sa pratīkāraḥ</skt> (that remedy depends on you), ibid. 277 <skt>yat tayāsya saktaṃ kiñcid gṛhītam asti tat samarpaya</skt> (give up that, which you have taken belonging to him).</small>
      </p>
      <p>3. <skt>pūrṇa</skt> (full) and its compounds. See 123.</p>
      <p>4. Those of <i>likeness</i> and <i>equality</i>. See 61.</p>
      <p class="rem" id="124-rem-e">Rem. Note <skt>dvitīya</skt> with gen., when subst. = »the match, the counterpart” Pat. I, 445 <skt>asya gordvitīyenārthaḥ</skt> (an other ox is wanted like this), Kathâs. 25, 178 <skt>aham evānayāmyasya dvitīyaṃ nūyurasya te</skt> (I will fetch you myself the match of this foot-ornament).</p>
      <p>5. A great number of adjectives admit of the dative-like genitive, see 129.</p>

      <p id="124-e1" type="note">
        (*1) <br />
        The Kâçikâ errs interpreting this sûtra so as to take <skt>āyukta</skt> and <skt>kuśala</skt>, as if they meant but these two words, though it is evident, that <i>two categories</i> of words are meant by Pāṇini, that of » occupation” (<skt>āyukta</skt>) and that of »skill” (<skt>kuśala</skt>). The rule given 1, 1, 68 — <skt>svaṃ rūpaṃ śabdasyāśabdasaṃjñā</skt> — is commonly interpreted in too narrow a sense. It does not purport that any word occurring in Pāṇini’s text, but for a <i>sanjñâ</i>, does signify but the word itself, not its synonyms — if this were so, we should have to enregister its violation every moment — but simply this: with the exception of such algebraical signs, as <skt>vu</skt> = <skt>aka</skt>, <skt>ṭha</skt> = <skt>eya</skt>, <skt>gha</skt> = the suffixes of the grades of comparison, sim., the sounds and words of which the vyâkaraṇa-sûtra is made up, are to be understood such as they are uttered. But it is left to the common sense of the reader to infer in each separate case , whether the word contained in the grammatical rule is meant as to its outer shape or as to its meaning, whether it is to denote but one or a whole class of words of the same purport, as <skt>āyukta</skt> and <skt>kuśala</skt> evidently do here. <br />
        For the rest, the vernacular grammarians themselves are obliged to admit of exceptions on their own interpretation of P. 1, 1, 68. See but the vârtt. on that sûtra.
