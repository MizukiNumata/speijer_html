      <h2>125. Ablative-like genitive.</h2>

      <p>
        IV. Sometimes the genitive is available in such cases as do properly belong to the category of the ablative, if there be at the same time room for the conception of „belonging to” and that of „proceeding from.” Of the kind we have already mentioned two instances, viz. 1. the genitive of origin (<a href="#113">113</a>), 2. that of the starting-point (<a href="#98">98</a>, R. 1 and 2). The latter is not limited to the cases, mentioned above, but is sometimes used side earring with by side with the ablative even with such nouns as <skt>uttara</skt>, <skt>dakṣiṇa</skt> etc., <small>Vishṇup. 2, 3, 1 <skt>uttaraṃ samudrasya</skt> (north of the ocean). {Concurring with the ablative.}</small>
