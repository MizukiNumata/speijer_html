      <h2>129. Dative-like genitive or <i>genitivus commodi et incommodi</i>.</h2>

      <p>V. The genitive serves also to denote him, who is concerned by the action or fact, the so-called <i>remote object</i>.</p>
      <p>This kind of genitive, as it stands on the same ground as the dative, I name <b>dative-like genitive</b>. Partly it may be substituted to the dative, but in a great number of cases the dative would even be unavailable, at least in classic Sanskrit, especially, if the person concerned is to be expressed <i>in such sentences, as where the predicate is nominal (substantive or adjective)</i>. In such turns as Kathâs. 29, 98 <skt>ihāmutra ca sādhvīnāṃ patirekā gatiḥ</skt> (for virtuous wives the only path to follow here and hereafter is their husband), Panc. II, 58 <skt>ko ’tibhāraḥ samarthānāṃ kiṃ krūraṃ vyavasāyinām / ko videśaḥ savidyānāṃ kaḥ paraḥ priyavādinām</skt> (what is too heavy for the vigorous? what danger does exist for the audacious? what is a foreign country for the learned? who is unattainable for the flatterer?) the genitive is the regular idiom, and the dative out of use. Likewise the genitive — not the dative — is to be employed, with adjectives of <i>friendship</i> and <i>enmity</i>, <i>fitness</i> and <i>unfitness</i>, <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i> etc., as Panc. 331 <skt>asya matsyāmiṣaṃ sadā priyam</skt> (a fish-dinner is always welcome to him), ibid. 213 <skt>na yuktaṃ bhavataḥ</skt> (it does not suit you).</p>
      <p>
        <small>Examples: Kumâr. 3, 10 <skt>ke mama dhanvino ‘nye</skt> (who are other archers to me?), Mrcch. VIll p. 246 <skt>madanaḥ] satpuruṣasya… bhavati mṛdurnaiva vā bhavati</skt> (the God of Love is either mild for an honest man or he does not exist for him), Mhbh. 1, 141, 36 <skt>avijñātā bhavaṣyāmo lokasya</skt> (we shall be unknown to the people), Panc. 200 <skt>yathārthavādino dṛtasya na doṣaḥ karaṇīyaḥ</skt> (one must not take it ill of a messenger, if he speaks plain), Çâk. IV <skt>bhartur viprakṛtāpi roṣaṇatayā māsma pratīpaṃ gamaḥ</skt> (do not oppose your husband by anger, even when offended).</small>
      </p>

      <h6>With adjectives, as <skt>priya</skt> etc.</h6>
      <p>
        <small>Among the adjectives, which comply with a gen., note such as <skt>anurūpa</skt>, <skt>anukūla</skt> and <skt>pratikūla</skt>, <skt>priya</skt> and <skt>vipriya</skt>, <skt>yogya</skt>, <skt>yukta</skt> — and even the verb <skt>yujyate</skt> (to suit) — and their synonyms. So Nala 1, 19 <skt>kariṣyāmi tava priyam</skt>, Panc. III, 104 <skt>ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareṣāṃ na samācaret</skt> (one should not do to others, what is grievous to one’s self), Mrcch. I, p. 58 <skt>ayogyamidaṃ nyāsasya gṛham</skt> (this house is not fit for a deposit), ibid. X, p. 355 <skt>na yujyate tava prāṇaparityāgaḥ</skt>, Mâlav. IV, p. 96 <skt>śītakriyā cāsyā rujaḥ praśistā</skt> (and cold is excellent against this ailment), Mhbh. 1, 15, 4 <skt>samaḥ sarvasya lokasya</skt> (the same to all beings), Mâlav, IV, p. 88 <skt>ka evaṃ vimukho ‘smākam</skt> (who is so disinclined to me?), ibid. III, p, 75 <skt>paryāptam etāvatā kāminām</skt> (so much suffices for persons in love).</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        <small>So <skt>sadṛśa</skt> and <skt>ucita</skt>, when = »becoming to, suiting.” R. 2, 30, 41 <skt>sarvathā sadṛśaṃ sīte mama svasya kulasya ca / vyavasāyam anukrāntā kānte tvam atiśobhanam</skt>; Çâk. I <skt>ucitam evaitat puruvaṃśaprabhavanarendrapradīpasya</skt>. As to <skt>arha</skt> and <skt>anarha</skt> cp. the foot-note on p. 40 of this book. Note also <skt>anagha</skt>, <skt>anṛṇa</skt> etc. with a gen. = »guiltless towards”, as R. 2, 49, 7 <skt>prajānām anagha</skt>, M, 9, 106 <skt>pitṝṇām anṛṇaḥ</skt> (having paid his debts to the <i>pitaras</i>).</small>
      </p>
      <p class="rem" id="129-rem-1-e">Rem. 1. Pāṇini teaches, that with participles in <skt>-ta</skt> the genitive must be used, and not the instrum. of the agent, if the participle is employed as a present one. {P. 2, 3, 67.} Such genitives as <skt>rājñāṃ mataḥ</skt> (approved by the kings), <skt>rājñāṃ pūjitaḥ</skt> (honored by the kings) fall within the limits of this rule. See Mhbh. 1, 141, 36 and Çâk. IV quoted above, and cp. Çâk. II <skt>vidito bhavān āśramasadāmihasthaḥ</skt> (your staying here is known to the hermits).</p>
      <p class="rem" id="129-rem-2-e">Rem. 2. On the genit. with krtyâs see 66 R, According to P. 2, 3, 69 the genitive is forbidden with the krts <skt>khalarthe</skt>, that is such as <skt>sulabha</skt>, <skt>īṣtkara</skt> (cp. P. 3, 3, 126 sq.). Kâç. gives as examples <skt>īṣadkaro</skt> (the mat is scarcely to be made by you), <skt>īṣatpānaḥ somo bhavatā</skt>. So R. 3, 5, 23 <skt>karma hy anena kartavyaṃ mahadanyaiḥ suduṣkaram</skt>. In fact, however, <skt>sukara</skt>, <skt>duṣkara</skt>, <skt>sulabha</skt>, <skt>durlabha</skt> are often construed with the genitive. Dâç. 72 <skt>dvitīyas tu sarvasyaiva sulabhaḥ</skt>, R. 2, 97, 7 <skt>neyaṃ mahī durlabhā</skt>, Kathâs. 24, 65 <skt>kiṃ nāma kitavasya hi duṣkaram</skt>.</p>
