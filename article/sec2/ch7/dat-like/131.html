      <h2>131. Dat.-like genitive with verbs.</h2>

      <p>The dative-like genitive attends even on verbs. Mrcch. X, p. 875 [kim asya pāpasyānuṣṭhīyatām] (what is to be done to this wicked man?) and ibid. X, p. 384 [kim asya bhikṣoḥ kriyatām] (what is to be done for this monk?) are striking examples of the sixth case used so. It is especially verbs of <i>doing good or evil</i> (as [upakṛ], [prasad], [apakṛ], [aparādh]), [viśvas] (to trust), [kṣam] (to forbear) and some others which partake of this idiom, its concurrent construction being the locative, rarely, if at all, the dative (*1).</p>
      <p>Examples: R. Gorr. 4, 38, 47 [mitrāṇāmupakurvaṇo rājyaṃ rakṣitum arhasi] (you must guard your kingdom by doing well to your friends), ibid, 3, 1, 16 [rāmasya satkṛtya] (offered hospitality to R.), Panc. 289 [kiṃ mayā tasyās tavāpi cāpakṛtam] (in what have I injured her or you?), Çâk. VII [aparāddho ‘smi tatrabhavataḥ kaṇvasya] (I have sinned against the reverend Kanva), Panc. 38 [sa na kasyacid viśvas iti] (he trusts nobody), Mhbh. 1, 23, 26 [prasīda naḥ prayācatām] (be merciful to us, who beseech thee), Mâlat, VII, p. 126 [vāyur yūnām abhinavavadhūsaṃnidhānaṃ vyanakti] (the wind declares to the young men the nearness of young women).</p>
      <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In Latin, with such turns as <i>adimo vestem servo</i> or <i>servi, civium</i> or <i>civibus dolor auctus est</i>, the dative and the genitive are both available. Sanskrit invariably uses the genitive. Panc. II, 141 [udyamena hi sidhyanti kāryāṇi na manorathaiḥ / na hi siṃhasya suptasya praviśanti mukhe mṛgāḥ] (it is by exertion, that enterprises are successful, not by wishing, deer do not enter the mouth of a sleeping lion), ibid. p. 145 [hiraṇyako ’pi mantharakasya praṇāmaṃ kṛtvā] (H. made his reverence to M.), ibid. 137 [mama mahatī prītiḥ saṃjātā] (I have got great pleasure).</p>

        (*1) <br />
        As to [aparādh], [upakṛ], [apakṛ], [viśvas], I do not remember having met with any instance of their agreeing with a dative; [kSam] governs a dative Bhaṭṭ. 4, 39. Upon the whole, the dative of profit and damage within its narrower limits is very scarce in Sanskrit, cp. 84.
