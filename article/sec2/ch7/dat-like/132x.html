      <h2>132*.</h2>

      <p>The dative of the purpose is not interchangeable with the genitive <a href="#132x-e1">(*1)</a>.</p>

        In the prâkṛts even then. It is singular, that an observer as accurate, as Pâṇini is, should have overlooked the important function of the dative-like genitive. A rule of his, indeed, mentions the sixth case <skt>caturthyarthe bahulam</skt> (2, 3, 62), but the word <skt>chandasi</skt> added and the examples proffered by tradition show that according to the vulgar interpretation we have here a very special enjoinment, closely connected to the preceding sutra (61), not one of general bearing. Yet I greatly doubt the exactness of that explication, by which the word <skt>caturthyarthe</skt> is quite superfluous, as <skt>devatāsaṃpradāne</skt> needs must be repeated from s. 61, and this suffices for the vulgar interpretation. Perhaps we may remove the technical difficulty by an other distribution of the words, that make up sûtra 61-63. When read <i>uno tenore</i>, we get <skt>preṣyabuvorhaviṣo devatāsaṃpradāne caturthyarthe bahulaṃ chandasi yajeś ca karaṇe</skt>. It would be convenient both to the internal probability and to the simplicity of the interpretation , if they are divided in this but slightly different manner: 61. <skt>preṣyabruvorhaviṣo devatāsaṃpradāne</skt>, 62. <skt>caturthyarthe bahulaṃ</skt>, 63. <skt>chandasi yajeś ca karaṇe</skt>. According to this partition, Pâṇini, after having given in 61 a special rule about the gen. being employed in some formulae of sacrificing, adds in 62 the general enjoinment <i>that in many cases, where the dative is required</i> — mark <skt>caturthyarthe</skt>, which encompasses by far more than <skt>saṃpradāne</skt> — <i>the genitive is likewise available, either by preference, or optionally, but not in all</i>. For thus is the meaning <skt>bahulam</skt>;

        (see <sCap>Boethlingk</sCap> <cite>Pâṇini</cite> II, p. 82). — As to sûtra 63 <skt>chandasi yajeś ca karaṇe</skt>, it offers no difficulty in itself, but disturbs the methodical arrangement of the rules which treat of the employment of the genitive (2, 3, 50-73). For this reason I consider it an additional rule, interpolated at an unproper place — we had rather expected it between s. 51 and 52 — so as to obscurate by its close following the sûtra 62, the right understanding of the latter. That there are several rules in our Pâṇini, which did not belong to the original work, but were at the outset vârttikâs, which afterwards have been taken up in the text, is a fact now universally acknowledged. As concerns the s. 63, I remark, that many other vaidik gen. partitives with verbs (<a href="#119">119</a>) are not mentioned by Pāṇini, and that the seeming anomaly of <skt>yaj</skt> (cp. <a href="#45">45</a> R.) must have drawn special attention for all that regarded that verb; in a time as early as Patanjali, it was already considered to have something peculiar, see his comment on P. 1, 4, 32 = Pat. I, p. 331 (in the Kâçikâ his words are wrongly indicated as if they were a vârttikâ).
