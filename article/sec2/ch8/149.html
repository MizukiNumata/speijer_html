          <h2>149. Locative expressive of a disposition towards.</h2>

          <p>In general, the locative may denote a disposition <i>towards somebody</i>. {P. 2, 3, 43.} Then it is synonymous with the prepos. <skt>prati</skt>, as <skt>devadattaḥ sādhur mātari</skt> or <skt>mātaraṃ prati</skt> (N. N. is good for his mother).</p>
          <p>Examples: Daç. 144 <skt>pratinivṛtto yuṣmāsu yathārhaṃ pratipatsye</skt> (when I shall be returned, I shall deal with you as you deserve), Çâk. I <skt>kathaṃ yathā vayam asyām iyam apy asmān prati</skt> (bow, can it be, that she feels towards me, as I towards her?), Panc. IV, 72 <skt>upakāriṣu yaḥ sādhuḥ sādhutve tasya ko guṇaḥ / apakāriṣu yaḥ sādhu sa sādhuḥ saddhir ucyate</skt> (if one is good for those, who have done well to him, what is his merit? only <i>he</i> is named good by the virtuous, who does well to his enemies), Çâk. IV <skt>bhava dakṣiṇā parijane</skt> (be kind to your household).</p>
