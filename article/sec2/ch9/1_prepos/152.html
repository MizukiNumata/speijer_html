      <h2>152. Prepositions.</h2>

      <p>Sanskrit prepositions should rather be styled ,,post-positions,” as they are generally put behind the nouns, they are construed with, <skt>ā</skt> being the one, that is always put before. As a rule, they are also allowed to be compounded with their nouns; in that case, the preposition is generally the former member <a href="#152-e1">(*1)</a>.</p>

      <p id="152-e1" type="note">
        (*1) <br />
        It is wrong to say that the noun-case, attending on the prepos., is <i>governed</i> by it, for it is not the preposition, that causes the case, but it is the general bearing of the case, which is qualified and limited by the preposition,
