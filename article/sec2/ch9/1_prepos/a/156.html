      <h2>156. <skt>adhi</skt>.</h2>

      <p>3. <skt>adhi</skt> is of frequent occurrence in the archaic and old epic writings. In the classic dialect it is still used to express the relation between the ruler and the ruled, as well the ruling <i>over</i> as the standing <i>under</i>; then it is construed with a locative. {P. 1, 4, 97.} It is said either <skt>adhi pañcāleṣu brahmadattaḥ</skt> (Brahmadatta <skt>ruling</skt> over the Pancâlas) or <skt>adhi brahmadatte pañcālāḥ</skt> (the P. under Br,) . So Daç. 112 <skt>adyaiva prahāravarmaṇyadhi videhā jātāḥ</skt> <a href="#156-e1">(*1)</a>.</p>
      <p>When put twice, it agrees with the accusative <a href="#171">(171 R.)</a></p>
      <p>When compounded with its noun, the compound is an adverb and is equivalent to the simple locative of the noun, especially to the nimittasaptamî <a href="#147">(147)</a>: <skt>adhistri</skt> (with respect to women), <skt>adhidaivatam</skt> (with respect to the deity), etc.</p>
      <p class="rem" id="156-rem-e">Rem. In the older dialect <skt>adhi</skt> is joined by loc., abl. and acc. With loc. it indicates the surface »on,” as in the old verse quoted</p>
      <p>by Pat. I, p. 4 <skt>bhadraiṣāṃ lakṣmīr nihitādhi vāci</skt> (holy bliss is seated on their tongues). — With abl. it signifies the coming »from”. — <i>With acc.</i> it is= »over, on [a surface];” so it is often met with in mantras, sometimes in the brâhmaṇas. Çat. Br. 1, 1, 4, 3 <skt>kṛṣṇājinam adhi dīkṣante</skt>.</p>

        According to P. 1, 4, 98 in tho case of <skt>adhikṛ</skt> (to appoint over) it may be said optionally either <skt>atra mām adhi kariṣyati</skt> or <skt>atra mām adhikariṣyati</skt> (he will put me over it). The Petrop. Dict., — I, p. 142 s. v. <skt>adhi</skt> 2) α) β)— wrongly takes <skt>mām</skt> for the word construed with <skt>adhi</skt>. It is not the acc. <skt>mām</skt> but the locat. <skt>atra</skt>, which stands in construction with the preposition, as is plainly shown by the meaning of the sentence.
