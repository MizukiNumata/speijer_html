      <h2>168. <skt>ā</skt>.</h2>

      <p>[8.] <skt>ā</skt> always agrees <i>with the ablative</i>, and is put before its noun. It serves to denote the boundary or limit, either the terminus a quo or the terminus ad quem, mostly the latter. It is available both in space and in time, and may be rendered accordingly now by „since” and „till”, now by „from” and „to.” M. 2, 22 is an example illustrative of its signifying the two termini <skt>ā samudrāt tu vai pūrvād ā samudrāt tu paścimāt / tayor evāntaraṃ giryor āryāvartaṃ vidurbudhāḥ</skt> (the wise know Âryâvarta to be the country between the said mountains <i>from</i> the eastern ocean <i>to</i> the western).</p>
      <small>
        <p>Other examples: 1. <i>term. a quo.</i> Çâk. I <skt>ā mūlāc chrotum icchāmi</skt> (I wish to hear it from the root); Kathâs. 24, 186 <skt>ā bālyāt tāpaso ‘bhavam</skt> (since my childhood I was an ascetic);</p>
        <p>2. <i>term. ad quem.</i> Mhbh. 1, 163, 8 <skt>ā karṇād dhinnadaktraḥ</skt> (having his mouth split up to the ears), Çâk. IV <skt>odakāntātsnigdho jano ’nugantavya iti śrūyate</skt>; — Çâk. V <skt>ā prasavād asmadgṛhe tiṣṭhatu</skt> (let her stay with us till her delivery), Âçv. Grhy. 1, 19, 5 <skt>ā ṣoḍaśād [viz. varṣād] brāhmaṇasyānanītaḥ kāla ā dvāviṃśāt kṣattriyasyā caturviṃśād vaiśyasya</skt> (until the sixteenth year the time is not passed for the brahman, etc.). — In a figurative sense f. i. Çâk. I <skt>ā paritoṣād viduṣāṃ na sādhu manye prayogavijñānam</skt> (I do not approve the skill of performing a representation, unless the connoisseurs be contented).</p>
        <p><skt>ā</skt> is often compounded with its noun into an avyayîbhâva. Daç. 175 <skt>ākaṇṭhaṃ papau</skt> (he drunk his fill, liter. »till his throat”), Kathâs. 5, 103 <skt>āsaṃsāraṃ jagatyasminnekā nityā hyanityatā</skt> (for, since the world exists, there is but one thing steady in the Creation, namely unsteadiness); Panc. I, 39 <skt>āmaraṇaṃ bhikṣā</skt> (a lifelong beggary).</p>
      </small>
      <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the vaidik mantras <skt>ā</skt> is of the utmost frequency, and is put to different cases, sometimes before, sometimes behind. In most instances it is rather a mere adverb. (*1).</p>

        (*1) <br />
        In a period as early as Yâska, <skt>ā</skt> with loc. had antiquated, for this exegete deems it necessary to interprete the mantric expression <skt>abhra ā apaḥ</skt> (water in the cloud) by <skt>apo ‘bhre ‘dhi</skt> (Nir. 5, 5). In a subsequent time the very gloss of Yâska would have required another, for <skt>adhi</skt> with loc. in this meaning being obsolete (156), classic Sanskrit would have employed <skt>antaḥ</skt> or <skt>-madhye</skt> or have said <skt>abhragatā apaḥ</skt>.
