      <h2>170. <skt>ārabhya</skt> and <skt>prabhṛti</skt>.</h2>

      <p><skt>ārabhya</skt> and <skt>prabhṛti</skt> <i>with preceding ablative</i> are very common. The former is properly a gerund = ,,beginning-, starting from,” <skt>prabhṛti</skt> is construed with abl. by so-called syntactic analogy, see Rem. 2.</p>
      <p>Examples of <skt>ārabhya</skt> = since. Panc. 288 <skt></skt>; Mâlat. VI, p. 88 <skt>mama śiśukālād ārabhyāśītirvarṣāṇi samanūvan</skt> (since the day I have seen M. for the first time).</p>

        <p>Examples of <skt>prabhṛti</skt> = since. Panc. 51 <skt>bālyāt prabhṛti sahacāriṇau</skt>; Mâlat. III, p. 50 <skt>manmathodyānayātrādivasātprabhṛti</skt> (since the day of the procession in the garden of Kâma); Mudr. II, p. 70 <skt>ākṣāpaya kutaḥ prabhṛti kathayāmi</skt>.</p>

      <p class="rem" id="170-rem-e-1">Rem. 1. They may also be used of space. Hit. 132 <skt>nakulavivarādārabhya sarpavivaraṃ yāvat</skt>; Kumâras. 3, 26 <skt>asūta sadyaḥ kusumānyaśokaḥ skandhāt prabhṛty eva</skt>.</p>
      <p class="rem" id="170-rem-e-2">Rem. 2. <skt>prabhṛti</skt> is originally a feminine, meaning »origin, commencement” and like its synonym <skt>Adi</skt>, it is often used at the ends of bahuvrîhis (<a href="#229">229</a> 1 1°). At the outset, therefore, such a term as <skt>tatkālaprabhṛti</skt> was said in the very same acceptation as <skt>tatkālādi</skt>, viz. meaning <skt>sa kālaḥ prabhṛtir yasya tat</skt>. By the time, however, the noun <skt>prabhṛti</skt> ceased to be employed as a separate word, and one commenced to look upon the adverbial compounds, ending in <skt>-prabhṛti</skt>, as if they were ending in some preposition, meaning »since.” By this mistake it happened that <skt>prabhṛti</skt> assumed even the character of a self-existent particle construed with ablative, by analogy of <skt>ārabhya</skt> and the like. Hence f. i. the compound <skt>janmaprabhṛti</skt> »since his birth” (M. 8, 90) represents an older idiom than <skt>janmanaḥ</skt>. In such turns as <skt>tadāprabhṛti</skt> (since then), <skt>yadāprabhṛti</skt> (since when), <skt>adyaprabhṛti</skt>, the true nominal nature of <skt>prabhṛti</skt> is plain, and it is again a misunderstanding to write them as two words <skt>tadā prabhṛti</skt> etc.</p>
