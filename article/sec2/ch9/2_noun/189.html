            Moreover <skt>sakāśāt</skt> — <small>and also, but not so often, <skt>antikāt</skt> and <skt>pārśvāt</skt></small> — serves also to periphrase many other kinds of ablative, especially if = ,,from the side of <i>a person</i>”.

              >So Panc. 28 <skt>svāminaḥ sakāśād abhayadakṣiṇā dāpayitavyā [sc. <skt>tvayā</skt>]</skt> (you must procure me safety from the side of your master), ibid. 137 <skt>bhoś citragrīvasya mayā tava sakāśāt pāśamokṣaṇaṃ dṛṣṭaṃ / tena mama mahatī prītiḥ saṃjātā / tat kadācin mamāpi vandhane jāte tava pārśvān muktair navati</skt> (well, I have seen how you have loosened Citragrîva of his fetters, and I was much pleased at this, for I too, if perchance I should get into captivity, may be released from your side); — to receive from: Mṛcch. X, p. 341 <skt>icchāmy ahaṃ bhavataḥ sakāśāt pratigrahaṃ kartum</skt>; — to ask from: Panc. 75 <skt>mayā tvat sakāśād bhojanam arthanīyam</skt>; — to learn from: M. 2, 20 <skt>etad deśaprasūtasya sakāśād agrajanmanaḥ / svaṃ svaṃ caritraṃ śikṣeranpṛthivyāṃ sarvamānavāḥ</skt>; — to buy from: M. 9, 174 <skt>krīṇīyād yas tv apatyārthaṃ mātāpitror yam antikāt / sa krītakaḥ</skt> (he whom somebody has bought from his parents that he might be instead of a son, is called his bought son); — to be borne from: Panc. 318 <skt>mama kanyāṃ dāsyati tat sakāśāt putro me bhaviṣyati</skt> (he will give me his daughter, of her I shall have a son). — Abl. of comparison: Panc. 271 <skt>atas taṃ saṃmānādibhiḥ sarveṣāṃ rājaputrāṇāṃ</skt> (from this time he looked on him with favour above all rajputs, showing his grace by marks of honour and the like), Vajracched. p. 16 <skt>asya khalu puṇyaskandhasyāntikād asau paurvakaḥ puṇyaskandhaḥ śatatamīm api kalāṃ nārhati</skt> (forsooth, if compared to the foresaid bulk of good works, this second bulk of good works is not equal to the hundredth part of it).</small
