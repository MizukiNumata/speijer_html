    <p>200. [uddizya].</p>
    <p>A similar periphrase is exhibited by the gerund [uddizya], as it is expressive of the aim the action is pointing at. Therefore [uddizya] may serve almost the same purpose as [prati], and is available as well in figurative as in literal sense. So Panc. 210 [svagRhamuddizya prapalAyitaH] (he fled to his home), Mudr. I, p. 8 [brAhmaNAnuddizya pAkaH] (the cooking for the brahmans). In the former instance the mere accus. [svagRham] would suffice, in the latter the gen. or dat. [brAhmaNAnAm] or [-NebhyaH].</p>
    <p>Other examples: R. 3, 11, 44 [rAmaH] pratisthe’gastyamuddizya] (- <i>to</span> Agastya), Kâd. I, p. 19 [rAjAnamuddizyAryAmimAM papATha] ([the bird] pronounced this âryâ with regard to the king), R. 3, 38, 13 [yajJAmuddizya dIkSitaH], Panc. 82 [nimittamuddizya prakupyati], (he is angry for some cause), Çâk. V [kimuddizya bhagavatA kAzyapena matsakAzamRSayaH preritAH syuH] (for what purpose — ?), etc.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Like []uddizya it is also said [samuddizya] or one makes use of kindred nouns, as [uddezena], [samuddezena], [uddezAt] all = »with regard to.”</p>
