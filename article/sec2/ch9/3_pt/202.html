    <p>202. {other gerunds.}</p>
    <p>Among the other gerunds, which may in some degree or other do duty of prepositions, we notice:</p>
    <p>1. those, expressing:..., concomitancy, as [AdAya] and [gRhItvA], when = ,,with;”</p>
    <p>2. such as are expressive of separation, as [muktvA], [varjayitvA], [parityajya] sim., as they are = ,,save, except, but for;”</p>
    <p>3. such as serve to denote the instrument, means, manner, in short, to periphrase the third case, as [AsthAya], [dvArIkRtya], [avalambya], [adhiSThAya];</p>
    <p>4. [vihAya] and [atItya] when = Lat. <i>prae</span> ,,in preference to;”</p>
    <p>5. [Arabhya] ,,since.”</p>

    <p>{[AdAya], [gRhItvA].}</p>
    <p>Examples: of 1. — Çâk. III [tataH pravizati kuzAnAdAya yajamAnaziSyaH] (enters a sacrificer’s disciple with kuçagrass); Panc. 173 [vittamAdAya samAyAtaH] (he came with money); R. 3, 24, 12 [gRhItvA vaidehIM…guhAmAzraya] (retire with Sîtâ into a cavern). — They are especially of use to point out the attributes or tools one takes along. Panc. III, 143 [sa [lubdhakaH] paJcarakamAdAya pAzaM ca laguDaM tathA / nityameva vanaM yAti]; Kathâs. 21, 134.</p>

    <p>{[muktvA], [varjayitvA], [parityajya].}</p>
    <p>of 2. — Panc. 203 [dharmaH muktvA nAnyA gatirasti] (there is no other path, <i>except</span> duty); R. 1, 67, 19 [nipetuzca narAH sarve tena zabdena mohitAH / varjayitvA munivaraM rAjAnaM tau ca rAghavau] (and all the people fell down, confounded by that sound, <i>save</span> Viçvâmitra, Janaka and the two Raghuides); Panc. 273 [mayAdhyainaM zRgAlazizuM parityajya na kiJcitsattvamAsAditam] (I have caught to day not a single animal <i>except</span> this brat of a chacal).</p>

    <p>{[varjam].}</p>
    <p>NB. Another implement of the same purport as [muktvA] etc. is [-varjam], always making up the latter part of a compound adverb. Var. Bṛh. 47, 28 [yadvistareNa kathitaM munibhistadasmin / sarvaM mayA nigaditaM punaruktavarjam] (all that has been told at large by the old seers, I have explained, save the repetitions).</p>

    <p>{[AsthAya].}</p>
    <p>of 3. — R. 1, 16, 2 [upAyaH ko vadhe tasya rAkSasAdhipateH surAH / yamahaM taM samAsthAya nihanyAmRSikaNTakam] (what way, ye gods, may lead to the death of that prince of Râxasas, <i>by</span> which means I may kill the disturber of holy men ?); Mudr. IV, p. 136 [na vayamamAtyarAkSasadvAreNa [cp. 196] kumAramAzrayAmahe kiM tu kumArasya senApatiM dvArokRtya] (we do not approach the Prince by the interference of Minister Râxasa but by that of the Commander of the Prince’s Army); Mâlav. II, p. 45 [rAjA / dAkSiNyamavalamvya] = [sadAkSiNyam] »courteously”.</p>
    <p>Likewise the participle [Asthita]. Panc. I, 243 [nRpatirlokAnpAlayedyatnamAsthitaH] = [yatnena lokAnpAlayet].</p>

    <p>{[vihAya] and [atItya].}</p>
    <p>of 4. — Çâk. II. [mUrkha anyameva bhAgadheyamete nirvapanti yo ratnarAzInapi vihAyAbhinandhyate] (fool, these holy men strew about a quite different tribute, which has a greater value than even heaps of</p>
    <p>precious stones); R. 2, 94, 26 [atItyaivottarAnkurUn / parvatazcitrakUTo] (Mount Citrakûta has even more roots, fruits and water than the land of the Hyperboreans).</p>

    <p>of 5: have been given already 170.</p>

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. This list is not complete. It may happen that some more gerunds are occasionally to be rendered by English prepositions or prepositional phrases. So [anAdRtya] may admit of the translation »in spite of,” [avaSTabhya] may be = Lat. <i>ob</span>, as R. 3, 18, 15 where etc. Çûrpaṇakhâ speaks so to Râma [imAM virUpAM…vRddhAM bhAryAmavaSTabhya na mAm tvaM bahu manyase] (it is for that old and ugly wife you do not esteem me), etc.</p>
