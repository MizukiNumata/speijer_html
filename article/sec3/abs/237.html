    <p>237. II. The instrumental of an abstract noun expressive of <i>in what quality</span>; „as’’</p>
    <p>II. Their instrumental, may signify in what quality somebody or something acts (67). Then it may be rendered by means of „as.’’ So Hitop. 103 <skt>kaścid vako dvitīyatvena prayātu} (let some other heron go with him <i>as</span> [his] <i>second</span>), Ratn. IV, p. 114 <skt>ayi priye kim adyāpi madhyasthatayā vartase} (why, my dear, do you behave <i>as if you were indifferent</span> even now ?).</p>
    <p>This idiom is much used with verbs of <i>acting</span>-, <i>behaving</span>-, <i>being as</span>; <i>knowing</span>-, <i>considering as</span>, <i>taking for</span>; <i>calling</span>-, <i>signifying as</span>; <i>treating as</span> and many others. Instead of the phrase <skt>brāhmaṇaṃ tvāṃ jānāmi saṃbhāvayāmi vyapadiśāmi} one may say <skt>brāhmaṇatvena tvāṃ jānāmi} etc.</p>
    <p>Examples: Kathâs. 26, 8 <skt>karṇadhāratayā sthitaḥ} (being steersman); Prabodh. IV, p. 81 <skt>tasya kāmaḥ prathamo vīras tasya prativīratayāsmābhir bhavān eva nirūpitaḥ} (Kâma is his chief warrior, it is you we have looked for <i>as his match</span>); Daç. 76 <skt>ṛṣim uktaś ca rāgaḥ saṃdhyātvenāskurat} (and the glow [of passion], which had been loosened from the holy man, [now] shone <i>as twilight</span>); Ragh. 14, 40 <skt>chāyā hi bhūmeḥ śaśino malatvenāropitā śuddhim ataḥ prajābhiḥ} (on spotless moon people have thrown earth’s shade <i>by way of a spot</span>); Daç. 112 <skt>māṃ tu na kaścid ihatya īdṛktayā jano jānāti} (nobody here <i>knows</span> me <i>as such</span>); ibid. 93 <skt>tvayā niyatam asmi tadāgatitvenāham apadeśyaḥ} (you cannot but <i>denounce</span> me <i>as the person</span>, you have got it from); ibid. 144 <skt>iyaṃ…tavaiva jāyātvena samakalpyata} (she has been <i>destined a wife</span> for you); ibid. 94 <skt>sa eva tapasvī taskaratvenārthapatir agrāhyata} (it was the unhappy Arth. who <i>was seized as the thief</span>); Pat. I, p. 399 when treating of the karmadhâraya <skt>kṛṣṇatilāḥ}, says <skt>tilāḥ prādhānyena vivakṣitā bhavanti kṛṣṇo viśeṣaṇatvena}; Kathâs. 52, 60 <skt>dāsītvenāśrayasi rājaputram}; Mhbh. 1, 43, 24 <skt>gacchadhvaṃ yūyam avyagrā rājānaṃ kāryavattayā}. (*1).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the instances quoted the abstracts are ending in <skt>-tayā} and <skt>-tvena}. But although these suffixes are the most employed ones, any other abstract has the same effect, Daç. 15 <skt>tadīryābhakayor yamajayor dhātrībhāvena parikalpitāham} (I was appointed nurse of the twins, his children); Kâç. I, p. 16 <skt>svam iti jñātidhanayoḥ saṃjñārūpeṇa vartate} (<i>sva</span> is used as a designation of kinsmen and property); Pat. I, p. 230 <skt>imān īndriyāṇi kadācit svātantryeṇa vivakṣitāni bhavanti tadyathā / idaṃ me ‘kṣi suṣṭhu praśyati / kadācit pāratantryeṇa / anenākṣṇā suṣṭhu paśyāmi}. For this reason, different abstracts made from one noun are as a rule promiscuous; compare f. i Kathâs. 13, 132 <skt>prayāti sma dūtyayā} with Hit. 97 <skt>prayātu daityena}, both <skt>dūtyayā} and <skt>daityena} signifying »in the quality of a messenger.’’</p>

    <p>The germ of this much used idiom is found already in the Ṛgveda-mantras, in such phrases as <skt>puruṣatā} (instr.=skrt <skt>puruṣatayā}). Ṛgv. 10, 15, 6 <skt>mā hiṃsiṣṭa pitaraḥ kena cinto yadva āgaḥ puruṣatā karām} (do us no injury I fathers, on account of any offence, that we, after the manner of men [as being men], may have committed against you).</p>
