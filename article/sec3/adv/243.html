    <p>243. Adjectives doing duty of adverbs.</p>
    <p>Sometimes — but not so often as in Latin and Greek — adjectives are used, where one might expect adverbs. Of the kind are f. i. <skt>vivaśa} = Lat. <i>invitus</span>, <skt>kevala} (mere). Kathâs. 28, 70 <skt>rambhā vivaśā sā tirodadhe} (R. disappeared against her will); Kathâs. 29, 120 <skt>yan na muktāsubhis tatra kāraṇaṃ kevalo vidhiḥ} (that she did not die, the cause thereof was nothing but Destiny, Germ. <i>nur das Schicksal</span>), Likewise others, which in fact serve to qualify the verb, though they do formally agree with some substantive (31, V). R. 3, 60, 25 <skt>mama visrabdhaḥ kathayasva} (tell it me confidentially), M. 3, 101 <skt>tṛṇāni bhūmir udakaṃ vāk caturthī ca sūnṛtā} (grass, earth, water, and fourthly, friendly speech). Compare these more instances, taken from the ancient language: Ait. Br. 1, 7, 13 <skt>uttamām aditiṃ yajati} (finally he worships Aditi), Ch. Up. 6, 6 <skt>sa ūrdhvaḥ samudīṣati} (it rises upwards), Âçv. Grhy. 1, 11, 5 <skt>udañcaṃ nayanti} (they lead [the victim] to the north).</p>
