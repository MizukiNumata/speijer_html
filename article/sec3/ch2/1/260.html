    <p>By pointing out <skt>bhavān} as the proper term for addressing in a polite manner, it is by no means said it is the sole. Many other titles, such as signify <i>sir</span>, <i>lord</span>, <i>reverend</span>, <i>master</span> are used according to duty, custom, dignity, age. So holy men are duly addressed by <skt>bhagavān} f. <skt>bhagavatī}, kings by <skt>devaḥ}, respectable merchants and the like by <skt>āryaḥ}, matrons by <skt>āryā}, the wife duly addresses her husband by <skt>āryaputraḥ}, the charioteer his prince by <skt>āyuṣmān} etc. As a rule a greater respect is shown by such titles than by using the general term <skt>bhavān} (vocat. <skt>bhoḥ}). Another difference is this: they may as well denote the 3rd person as the 2nd, whereas <skt>bhavān} is only fit for denoting the 2nd person.</p>
    <p>Moreover there are some general terms, made up of <skt>bhavān} preceded by some pronominal prefix, viz. <skt>atrabhavān}, <skt>tatrabhavān}, <skt>sabhavān}. As <skt>sabhavān} and <skt>tatrabhavān} point at somebody absent, but the <skt>atrabhavān} always present, so the former two cannot refer but to a 3rd person, but <skt>atrabhavān} may denote as well the person spoken of as the person addressed.
