    <p>The reflexives are not bound to refer exclusively to the grammatical subject. In passive sentences they often refer to the agent, in clauses and the like to the main subject. Instances hereof have already been given in 264 and 265, viz. Panc. 263; Panc. III, 174; Kâd. I, 19; Hit. 137; Vikram. I, p. 2. Here are some more: Panc. 24 <skt>na śobhanaṃ kṛtaṃ mayā yat tasya viśvāsaṃ gatvātmābhiprāyo niveditaḥ}, here <skt>ātmābhiprāyaḥ} is of course <skt>mamātmano ‘bhiprāyaḥ}; R. 2, 11, 22 <skt>vāṅmātreṇa tadā rājā kaikeyyā svavaśaṃ kṛtaḥ} sc. <skt>kaikeyyā vaśam}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. On the other hand, one may meet with instances of pronouns not-reflexive, in such cases as where one might expect reflexives. So R. 3, 62, 8 <skt>tvam aśokasya śākhābhiḥ…āvṛṇoṣi śarīraṃ te} [not <skt>svam} or <skt>ātmanaḥ}]; Kathâs. 36, 102.</p>
