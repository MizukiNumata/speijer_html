    <p>It is in such instances of <i>anvâdeça</span> (reference to something already named before), that the pronoun bears almost the character of our <i>he, she, it</span>. — 1. <skt>asya} etc. enclitic: Mrcch.

    <p>NB. The instr. <skt>enena} and <skt>enayā} seem to be extremely rare; <skt>anena} at least and <skt>anayā} are regularly used,when <i>anvâdeça</span> is required. Mâlav.
