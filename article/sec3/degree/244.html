          <p>Of two persons or things, possessing the same quality, the <b>comparative</i> is to point out that which is endowed with the <i>higher degree</i> of it: {P. 5, 3, 57.} <skt>sādhutaras tayoḥ</skt> (the better of these two), <skt>vico madhunaḥ svādīyaḥ</skt> (words, sweeter than honey). Even if the person or thing compared with, be implied, not expressed, the comparative may be used. We then translate it by „tolerably, rather.’’<a href="#244-e1">(*1)</a> <small>Daç. 159 <skt>tato ‘lpīyasā kālena rājñaḥ priyamahiṣī</skt> (not very long hereafter —), Prabodh.
