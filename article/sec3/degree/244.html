    <p>244. Comparative.</p>
    <p>Of two persons or things, possessing the same quality, the <b>comparative</span> is to point out that which is endowed with the <i>higher degree</span> of it: {P. 5, 3, 57.} <skt>sādhutaras tayoḥ} (the better of these two), <skt>vico madhunaḥ svādīyaḥ} (words, sweeter than honey). Even if the person or thing compared with, be implied, not expressed, the comparative may be used. We then translate it by „tolerably, rather(*1).’’ Daç. 159 <skt>tato ‘lpīyasā kālena rājñaḥ priyamahiṣī} (not very long hereafter —), Prabodh. II, p. 30 <skt>mayā svagṛhiṇī priyasy api projihitā} (I have abandoned my wife, though I loved her very much), Panc. 35 <skt>tac chrutvā piṅgalakaḥ sādarataraṃ tam uvāca} (after hearing this , P. addressed him in a rather respectful manner). — Occasionally the comparative may even express »too.” Mhbh. I (Paushyaparva) Upamanyu, when asked by his master why he looks fat though every opportunity of getting food has been intercepted to him, answers he has drunk the foam, given back by the calves after having drunk the milk of their mothers. But even that livelihood displeases his spiritual teacher, for <skt>ete tvad anukampayā guṇavanto vatsāḥ prabhūtataraṃ phenam udgiranti / tad eṣām api vatsānāṃ vṛtty uparodhaṃ karoṣi} (these virtuous calves give back <i>too much</span> foam, for pity on you, for this reason you prevent also their being fed).</p>
