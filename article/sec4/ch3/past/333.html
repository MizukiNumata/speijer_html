    <p>333. Periphrastic perfect.</p>
    <p>There is no syntactical difference between the perfect simple and that, which is made by periphrase with <skt>āsa}, <skt>cakāra} med. <skt>cakre}, and <skt>babhūva}.</p>
    <p>In the brâhmaṇas <skt>cakāra} and <skt>cakre} are almost exclusively used for this purpose (*1). Nor does Pâṇini teach other auxiliaries (*2). But even in the epic poems all of them are used, especially <skt>āsa}, which seems also afterwards to be the most frequent, whereas <skt>babhūva} is the rarest.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>In the Aitar. Brâhm. the periphr. perfect with <skt>āsa} is used but once. See the edition of Aufrecht, p. 429.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>To interprete P. 3, 1, 40 <skt>kṛñaḥ}, as if it were a pratyâhâra of <skt>kṛ} + <skt>bhū} + <skt>as}, is, not to mention other objections, too artificial and too subtle, to be true. Pâṇini knew, or at least approved, no other periphrastic perfect, than that which is made with <skt>kṛ}.</p>
