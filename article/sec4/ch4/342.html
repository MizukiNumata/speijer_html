    <p>342. Subjunctive mood.</p>
    <p>The subjunctive mood is expressed in Sanskrit by four tenses: 1. <skt>liṅ}, called by some <b>optative</span>, by others <b>potential</span>, 2. <skt>āśiṣi liṅ} the <b>precative</span> or <b>benedictive</span>, 3. <skt>lṛṅ} the <b>conditional</span>, 4. <skt>loṭ} the <b>imperative</span>. The dialect of the Veda (mantra and brâhmaṇa) has moreover a fifth tense called <skt>leṭ}, by vernacular, conjunctive by European grammarians, which was already obsolete in the days of Pâṇini. The duties of the missing tense are performed by the imperative, partly also by the present (<skt>laṭ}). Nor is the present the only tense, which apart from its expressing the indicative, may sometimes have the force of a subjunctive; for the future in <skt>-syati} — and, in prohibitions, even the aorist — is occasionally concurrent with <skt>liṅ} and <skt>loṭ}. That the conditional (<skt>lṛṅ}) was at the outset an indicative tense, appears sufficiently not only from its outer form, but also from its original employment. Upon the whole, the boundaries between indicative and not-indicative are less marked in Sanskrit than in Latin and Greek.</p>
