    <p>345. liṅ expressive of the <i>past</span> as well as the <i>present</span>.</p>
    <p>Sanskrit makes no distinction between the different tenses of the subjunctive mood. The <skt>liṅ} express the past as well as the present. <skt>kuryām} may be occasionally = „I might, I would etc. <i>have done</span>.” Ch. Up. 4, 14, 2 when the teacher asks his disciple, who has taught you, my dear?” <skt>saumya ko nu tvānuśaśāsa}, the other replies <skt>ko nu mānuśiṣyāt} (who should have taught me?), Gaut. 12, 1 <skt>śūdro dvijātīnatisaṃdhāyābhihatya vāgdaṇḍapāruṣyābhyāmaṅaṃ mocyo yenopahanyāt} (a çûdra, who has intentionally reviled twice-born men — shall lose the member, whereby he has offended), Mrcch. III, p. 124 Cârudatta speaks <skt>cirayati maitreyaḥ / mā nāma vaiklavyādakāryaṃ kuryāt} (Maitreya tarries; how, if, in his distress, be should have done some forbidden thing!). Yet an optative of the past may be made by adding <skt>syāt} or <skt>bhavet} to the participle of the past, f. i. Kathâs. 27, 32 <skt>kiṃ mayāpakṛtaṃ rājño bhavet} (in what can I have offended the king?). (*1) Likewise, by putting them to the participle of the future one gets the subjunctive mood of the future.</p>
    <p>For the rest, Sanskrit can hardly be said to possess something like <i>tenses</span> of the subjunctive mood. (*2) Only a kind of optative of the aorist has survived, but it is not what we should call a tense. It is rather a kind of mood, see the next paragraph.</p>

    <p>So already in the archaic dialect. Ait. Br. 1, 4. 1 <skt>yaḥ pūrvam anījānaḥ syāt tasmai} (to such a one, as has not sacrificed formerly), <skt>ījāna} is the partic. of the perf. âtm. of <skt>yaj}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>The Ṛgvedamantas, indeed, contain many optatives, belonging to the aorist, some also, which are made of the stem of the perfect. But they have early disappeared from the language. — In the archaic dialect the conditional may occasionally do duty of the past of the <skt>liṅ}, see 347 R. and cp. P. 3, 3, 140.</p>
