    <p>351. II. Imperative expressive of wishes.</p>
    <p>II. The imperative is expressive of <i>wishes</span> and <i>benedictions</span>.</p>
    <p>Examples: Such phrases as <skt>ciraṃ jīva}, Hit. 118 <skt>gaccha vijayī bhava}, Nâgân. IV, p. 61 <skt>vijayetāṃ kumārau} (may the princes be victorious), Panc. 16 <skt>śivāste panthānaḥ santu} (v. a. God speed you on your way), Mudr. VII, p. 231 <skt>ciram avatu mahīṃ pārthivaś candraguptaḥ}. — Here the precative (346) and the <skt>liṅ} are concurrent idioms.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. It is to benedictions that the imperative in <skt>-tāt} is limited in the classic language. {P. 7, 1, 35.} Daç. <skt>enam āyuṣmantaṃ pitṛrūpo bhavān abhirakṣatāt}. (*1) In the ancient dialect it had a wider employment, only see the series of precepts quoted Ait. Br. 2, 6, 13-16. (*2)</p>

    <p>Another instance is pointed out by prof. Kern as occurring in a Sanskrit inscription on a stone, originating from Java, which stone is now in the Museum of Antiquities at Calcutta. Vs. 4 of this metrical inscription has this close: <skt>sa jayatāderlaṅganāmā nṛpaḥ} (king Erlanga may be victolious). See Kern’s paper in the <i>Bijdragen van het Instituut voor de Taal- Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Indië</span>, 1885 (X, p. 1-21).</p>

    <p>Delbrück, <i>Altindische Wortfolge</span>, p. 2-6 has endeavoured to prove that the imper. in <skt>-tāt}, did duty of an imperative or the future in the dialect of the brâhmaṇa-works.</p>
