    <p>349. Courteous injunction.</p>
    <p>In courteous injunctions and requests it is very common to use the imperative of the passive instead of the 2d person of the active. Then the agent is commonly not expressed (10). Ratnâv. IV, p. 100 king to messenger <skt>kathaya kathāmativistarataḥ}, messenger to king <skt>deva śrūyatām} (listen, Sire), Panc. 48 the barber enjoins his wife <skt>bhadre śīghramānīyatāṃ kṣurabhāṇḍam} (please, my dear, fetch me m y razorbox). Vikram. I, p. 4 the apsarasas are bewailing their companion Urvaçî, carried off by the Dânavas, Purûravas intervenes and says <skt>alamākranditena / purūravasaṃ māmetya kathyatāṃ kuto bhavatyaḥ paritrātavyā iti}. — For the rest, <skt>bhavān} is of course here likewise available (Mâlav. I, p. 4 <skt>tvaratāṃ bhavān}) and when showing respect and reverence, one uses the title of the person addressed instead of it (260). So Panc. 86 <skt>tadadya māṃ bhakṣayitvā prāṇāndhārayatu svāmī} is a more respectful more of inviting, than <skt>svāmin prāṇāndhāraya}, cp. ibid. 48 <skt>śṛṇvantu bhavantaḥ sabhāsadaḥ} (v. a. I request the judges to listen).</p>
