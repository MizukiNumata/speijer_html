    <p>Additional remarks. — 1. As participles of the future in the active may be considered also <i>a.</span>) the kṛts in <skt>-u}, derived from desideratives, as <skt>cikīrṣu} (wishing to do, being about to do), cp. 52 a, f. i. Daç. 166 <skt>tatra ca svādu pānīyamedhāṃsi kandamūlaphalāni saṃjighṛkṣavaḥ… avātarāma} (and there [on that island] we descended, desiring to take sweet water, fuel, turnips, roots and fruits); <i>b.</span>) some in <skt>-in}, mentioned by P. 3, 3, 3, as <skt>gamī grāmam} (one, who will go to the village), they do even duty as finite verbs: Kathâs. 35, 104 <skt>uttiṣṭha rājan bhāvī te vīro vaṃśadharaḥ sutaḥ} (get up, my king, a son will be born to you —), Vikram, V, p. 181 <skt>surāsuravimardo bhāvī} = <skt>-bhavitā}; <i>c.</span>) those in <skt>-aka}, when put close to the chief verb; they are expressive of a purpose, cp, 52 <i>c</span>. (*1).</p>
    <p>2. Further there are the old participles of the past, formed with reduplication, such as <skt>cakṛvān}, f. <skt>cakruṣī}, n. <skt>cakṛvat} for the active voice, and <skt>cakrāṇaḥ} for the passive. In classic Sanskrit they have almost wholly got out of use. Already Pâṇini restricts them to Holy Writ, with the exception of six, viz. <skt>sedivān}, <skt>ūṣivān}, <skt>śuśruvān}, the compounds <skt>anāśvān}, <skt>upeyivān}, <skt>anūcānaḥ}. {P. 3, 2, 106-109.} The participle in <skt>-vān} (<skt>vāṃs}) is, however, oftener met with in the post-Pâṇinean literature, than would be expected by this rule, but it occurs chiefly in epic poetry and in kâvyas. Mhbh. 1, 44, 10 <skt>vijahrivān}, R. 1, 26, 25 <skt>vineduṣī}, Kathâs. 25, 72 <skt>anidrasya niṣeduṣaḥ}, Kumâras. 2, 4 <skt>namastubhyaṃ… bhedam upeyuṣe}, ibid. 6, 72 <skt>padam ātasthuṣā tvayā}, ibid. 6, 64 <skt>ity ūcivāṃs tam evārtham}, Kathâs. 81, 31, Çiçup. 1, 17 etc. That it may even do duty as finite verb, has been mentioned 338. But the participle of the past in <skt>-ān} has wholly antiquated, and is only met with in the archaic dialect, see f. i. Çat. Br. 3, 9, 1, 1; 11, 1, 6, 8 etc.</p>
