    <p>365. Absolute cases.</p>
    <p>As the participle is an adjective noun, it needs must rest on some substantive, of which it is the predicate, and with which it is to agree in gender, number and case (27). We may call this substantive the <i>subject</span> of the participle. When being a pronoun, it is often not expressed (10), as little when a general subject. But, whether understood or expressed, it is likely to form part of the chief sentence, and by its noun-case, which is at the same time that of the participle, it marks the nature of the logical relation, which exists between the principal action and the subordinate one.</p>
    <p>Yet, the participial employment is not restricted to the case, that the subject of the participle occurs in the chief sentence. In Sanskrit, like many other languages, it extends also to the absolute cases, by which name one denotes the participle with its subject, if they are but loosely connected with the principal sentence, their noun-case not being grammatically dependent on any word or phrase in the chief sentence. Sanskrit has two absolute cases: the <i>locative</span> and the <i>genitive</span>. Of these, the former is the general one, the latter has a much narrower employment.</p>
