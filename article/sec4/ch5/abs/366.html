    <p>366. Absolute locative.</p>
    <p>The <b>absolute locative</span> is a very frequent idiom. It is the Sanskrit counterpart of the Latin absolute ablative and the like genitive of Greek. {P. 2, 3, 37.} It shares the whole manysidedness of signification of the participial employment. In other terms, it is equivalent to any kind of subordinate sentence: temporal, modal, causal, conditional, hypothetical, concessive, etc.</p>
