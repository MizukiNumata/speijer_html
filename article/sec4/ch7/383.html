    <p>383. Sanskrit infinitive. Its employment.</p>
    <p>Sanskrit <b>infinitive</span> is a much employed form. It serves to denote <i>aim</span> and <i>purpose</span>, almost to any extent and without restriction. {P. 3, 3, 10.} As a rule, the infinitive in <skt>tum} may be put to any predicate, just as the dative of the purpose, to which it is equivalent. In 87 we have quoted a striking instance of this equivalence, Çâk. I <skt>ārtatrāṇāya vaḥ śastraṃ na prahartum anāgasi}. Other examples of the infinitive being expressive of the aim may be Mhbh. 1, 160, 15 <skt>na ca me vidyate vittaṃ saṃkretuṃ puruṣaṃ kvacit} (and I have no money to buy some man somewhere), R. 2, 52, 9 <skt>tava… tartuṃ sāgaragāminīṃ nauriyam} (here is a ship for you to cross the river), Daç. 40 <skt>duṣṭahṛdayam enaṃ nihantuṃ mṛdur upāyaḥ kaścin mayā cintyate} (I devise some gentle means for killing that scoundrel), R. 1, 42, 24 <skt>tāṃ vai dhārayituṃ rājan nānyaṃ paśyāmi śūlinaḥ} (I know no one but Çiva, to bear her [the Gangâ]).</p>
