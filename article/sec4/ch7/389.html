    <p>389. Infin. with yukta.</p>
    <p>Another similar turn is the infinitive with <skt>yuktaṃ} (it is fit, it suits). If neither the subject nor the object of the action befitting is expressed, there is no difficulty; one should needs say f.i. <skt>na yuktam iha sthātum}, no other turn of phrase being available. But when the subject or object or both of them are to be expressed, there is variety of idioms. l. The object may be an <i>accusative</span>; 2. the object may be a <i>nominative</span> construed with <skt>yuktam}; 3. the object may be a <i>nominative</span>, whose gender and number are transferred also to the adjective <skt>yukta}. As to the subject, it is put in the instrumental or in the genitive; (*1) the latter seems to be more frequent.</p>
    <p>Examples: 1 of <skt>yuktam} with an accus. Mudr. I, p. 30 <skt>na yuktaṃ prākṛtam api ripum avajñātum} (it is not judicious to disdain even a mean enemy), Varâh. Bṛhats. 47, 2 <skt>bhūyo varāhamihirasya na yuktam etat kartum} (V. ought not to treat the same matter again), Mhbh. I, Pauahyap. 118 <skt>na yuktaṃ bhavatānnamaśuci dattvā pratiśāpaṃ dātum} (it does not become you, after having given unclean food, to return the curse);</p>
    <p>2. of <skt>yuktam} with a nomin. Mhbh. I, Pauahyap. 106 <skt>na yuktaṃ bhavatāham anṛtenopacaritum} (it is not right that you should treat me with lies); (*2)</p>
    <p>3. of <skt>yuktam} agreeing in gender and number with the nomin. Kathâs. 22, 169 <skt>yuktā pariṇetum asau mama} (v. a. she suits me as a wife).</p>

    <p>{with nyâyya;}</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. In the same way <skt>nyāyya} with infinitive admits of two constructions. Sometimes it is a neuter with the acc. of the object, as R. (Gorr.) 6, 38, 28 <skt>na naptāraṃ nyāyyaṃ śaptum evam} (it is not allowed to curse one’s own grand-son in this manner), sometimes it is construed with a nomin. of the object, the gender and number of which itself adopts, and the instrum. of the subject, as Ragh. 2, 55 <skt>seyaṃ… nyāyyā mayā socayituṃ bhavattaḥ} (it is right she should be released from you by me).</p>

    <p>{with varam and asâṃpratam.}</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. With the turn <skt>yuktam} with nomin. may be compared the nominative with infinitive, attending such adverbs as <skt>asāmpratam} and <skt>varam}. Kumâras. 2, 55 <skt>viṣavṛkṣo ‘pi saṃvardhya svayaṃ chettum asāṃpratam} (even a poisonous tree should not be cut down by him, who has reared it); — Mâlav. III, p. 55 <skt>ucitaḥ praṇayo varaṃ vihantum} (it is better, that a love to which one is accustomed, should be repressed —), Daç. 94 <skt>varam ātmā gopāyitum} (it is better to defend ourselves). With <skt>varam} one may also meet with the nom. of the kṛtya almost doing duty as infin., f. i. Nâgân. IV, p. 58 <skt>varaṃ rājaputryāḥ sakāśaṃ gantavyam} (better is it to go to the encounter of the princess).</p>
