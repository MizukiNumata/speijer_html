    <p>After treating the syntax of nouns and verbs, we now come to the words which are devoid of inflection. Part of them, indeed, have already been dealt with, viz. the adverbs in Ch. I of the Third, and the prepositions in Ch. IX of the Second Section. The rest are the so-called particles, most of them old little words as <skt>ca}, <skt>hi}, <skt>v훮}, <skt>iva}, <skt>api}, whereas some others, as <skt>k훮mam}, <skt>t훮vat}, <skt>param}, are petrified noun-cases. As to the employment of the particles, they serve different purposes, but they may be brought under two general heads: <i>modality</span> and <i>connection</span>. When modal, they are expressive of emphasis, negation, interrogation, exclamation and the like, when connective they are wanted to connect either whole sentences or parts of them. The distinction between these two classes of particles is, however, not an essential one. The same word may be sometimes a modal, sometimes a connective. So <skt>api} may be a particle of interrogation, but also of copulation, <skt>v훮} commonly a disjunctive, serves occasionally to express emphasis. And so on.</p>
    <p>Sanskrit likes putting together and even combining two or more particles.</p>
