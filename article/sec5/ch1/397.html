    <p>Ancient literature abounds in emphatic particles, many of which are obsolete in the classic dialect. Besides <skt>khalu}, <skt>nāma}, <skt>hi} we meet in archaic and epic works with <skt>vai}, <skt>ha}, <skt>sma}, <skt>nu}, <skt>u}, <skt>uta}, <skt>vā}. Often these little particles only slightly strengthen the sense, and rather serve either to enhance the dignity of the style or to fill up the metre.</p>

    <p>{Expletives.}</p>
    <p>Then we may call them expletives (*1). But they are not always used in this way, and each of them at the outset had its proper meaning.</p>
    <p>Accumulation of them is not rare, as <skt>ha sma}, <skt>ha vai}, <skt>u khalu} etc.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. <skt>vai} is especially used to lay stress on the word immediately preceding. It is excessively frequent both in liturgical and in epic writings. Still Patanjali used it sometimes. Pat I, p. 107 <skt>akarmakā api vai sopasargāḥ sakarmakā bhavanti} (nay, even intransitives become transitives, when compound). But afterwards it seems to be obsolete, at least in prose. — <skt>vā} = <skt>vai} is occasionally found in epic poetry.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. <skt>ha} and <skt>uta} are much liked at the end of a pâda, the former after a finite verb, <skt>uta} in the phrase <skt>ity uta}. But they may also have other places; <skt>ha} is very frequent in the brâhmaṇas, well as in the epics. (*2)</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. Some, as <skt>śaśvat} and <skt>vāva}, are found in the brâhmaṇas, but not in the epics. The emphatic and also restrictive particle <skt>aha} is often met with in the mantras and in the Çatapathabr., <skt>cit}, <skt>īm} and <skt>kam} are restricted to the mantras.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*1)</p>
    <p>And so does vernacular grammar. Even as ancient an author as Yâska knows of particles which serve <skt>pādapūraṇe}.</p>

    <p id="hoge" class="note">(*2)</p>
    <p>P. 8, 1, 60 mentions <skt>ha}, when denoting disapproval at some infringement on good manners. Kâç. illustrates this rule a. o. by the example <skt>svayaṃ ha rathena yāti / upādhyāyaṃ padātiṃ gamayati}. In this sense also <skt>aha} is used [P, 8, 1, 61], moreover, when orders are given to different persons at the same time, f. i. <skt>tvam aha grāmaṃ gaccha / tvam ahāraṇyaṃ gaccha} (Kâç.).</p>
