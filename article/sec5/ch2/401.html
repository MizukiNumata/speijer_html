    <p>401. na. Its place in the sentence.</p>
    <p>The general negation is <skt>na}. It negatives as well single words or notions as whole statements. In the former case it is put immediately before the word denied. Panc. 147 <skt>parijñātastvaṃ samyaṅ na suhṛt} (I have clearly experienced you to be an unfriend).</p>
    <p>When denying the whole statement, one is tolerably free where to put the negation. Commonly, two places are preferred: either at the head of the whole sentence — so regularly for rhetorical purposes, as in the case of antithesis, epanaphora, also in emphatical denials — or just before the verb. Yet, as has been said, any other place is admissible and very often met with, especially in poets.</p>
    <p>Examples: <skt>na} heading the sentence. Panc. 26 <skt>na dīnopari mahāntaḥ kupyantīti na tvaṃ tena nipātitaḥ} (as men of superior rank do not feel angry towards a wretch, he has not killed you), Mudr. IV, p. 187 <skt>na mayā suciramapi vicārayatā teṣāṃ vākyārtho ‘dhigataḥ} (though I have been reflecting on it quite a while, I do not understand what it is, they speak of); — of <skt>na} just before the verb: Panc. 48 <skt>nāpito vaktuṃ na śaśāka}, Hit. 95 <skt>ko ‘py upāyo ‘smākaṃ jīvanāya nāsti}.</p>
    <p>anaphora: Panc. I, 4 <skt>na sā vidyā na tad dānaṃ na tacchilpaṃ na sā kalā / arthārthibhir na tatsthairyaṃ dhanināṃ yan na gīyate} (no knowledge, no munificence, no skill, no art, no perseverance can be imagined which is not praised in the wealthy by those who desire profit of them); — emphatic denial: Panc. 54 the weaver, who acts the part of Vishṇu says to the princess <skt>subhage nāhaṃ darśanapathaṃ mānuṣāṇāṃ gacchāmi}.</p>
    <p>Instances of another place, than at the head or be fore the verb: Daç. 198 <skt>tam alam asmi nāham uddhartum} (I am not able to rescue him), Hit. 9 <skt>ahaṃ… na kathaṃ viśvāsabhūmiḥ}, Kumâras. 5, 5 <skt>sutāṃ śaśāka menā na niyantumudyamāt}, Panc. I, 27 <skt>kiṃ tena jātu jātena… ārohati na yaḥ svasya vaṃśasyāgre dhvajo yayā}; ibid. II, 168 <skt>vāñchā nivartate nārthaiḥ} = <skt>nārthair vāñchā ni-}; Kathâs. 24, 171 <skt>tat kiṃ tvam eva mūlyena gṛhṇāsyābharaṇaṃ na tat}.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. <skt>na} is sometimes by itself the whole predicate, the verb being implied. Daç. 156 <skt>tasmai ceyam anumatā dātum itarasmai na} (she was destined for him, not for another), Panc. 116 <skt>sādhoḥ śikṣā guṇāya saṃpadyate nāsādhoḥ} (education turns to advantage in a good man, but in a wicked one not so).</p>
