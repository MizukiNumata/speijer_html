    <p>Other remarks on the interrogative pronoun and its derivatives. — 1. They may depend on participles, gerunds and the like, also subordinate sentences. Mhbh. 1, 162, 11 <skt>tasya vyavasitas tyāgo buddhim āsthāya kāṃ tvayā} (v. a, what motive has made you decide to abandon this [man]?), Mudr. I, p. 28 <skt>yadi kiṃ syāt} (if what would be?).</p>
    <p>2. Nothing precludes the presence of more interrogatives, referring to different things, in the same sentence. Pat. I, p. 241 <skt>keṣv artheṣu kāñ śabdān prayuñjate} (what sounds do they employ [and] in what meanings?), Kathâs. 41, 37 <skt>ko ‘rhī prārthayate kaḥ kiṃ kasmai kiṃ dīyatām iti} (who is indigent? who begs [and] for what? to whom should be given [and] what?).</p>
    <p>3. Some particles, viz. <skt>vā}, <skt>svit}, <skt>iva}, <skt>nu}, <skt>u}, <skt>nāma}, are subjoined to them, in order to express some interest taken in the question by the speaker. Cp. the like duty of Lat. - <i>nam</span> and <i>tandem</span>, Greek <i>ποτέ</span>, French <i>donc</span>. Çâk. I <skt>mānuṣīṣu kathaṃ vā syād asya rūpasya saṃbhavaḥ} (is it then possible, that such a beauty should be of human origin?); Mhbh. 1, 91, 8 <skt>kati svid eva mṛnayaḥ kati maunāni cāpy uta / bhavantīti tadācakṣva śrotum icchāmahe vayam}; R. 2, 38, 8 <skt>apakāraṃ kamiva te karoti janakātmajā} (what possible injury can Janaka’s daughter do you then?); Ch. Up. 4, 14, 2 <skt>brahmavida iva saumya te mukhaṃ bhāti / ki nu tvānuśaśāsa} (friend, your face shines like that of one who knows Brahman; who has taught you?); Kathâs. 16, 9 <skt>kiṃ nāma na sahante hi bhatṛbhaktāḥ kulāṅganāḥ}.</p>
    <p>4. Note the phrase <skt>ko ‘yam} (who is it, that — here?), f. i. Hit. 21 <skt>tatastamāyāntaṃ dṛṣṭvā pakṣiśāvakair bhayārtaiḥ kolāhalaḥ kṛtaḥ / tac chrutvā jaradgavenoktaṃ / ko ‘yam āyāti}.</p>
    <p>5. <skt>kim} may do duty as a particle, see 412, 3°.</p>
