    <p>411. Interrogatives and relatives in indirect questions.</p>
    <p>In indirect questions the interrogatives are employed, but instead of them the relatives are also admissible. Kathâs. 39, 174 <skt>paśyainaṃ vañcaye katham} (see, how I delude him), Panc. 55 <skt>jñāyatāṃ kim ete kañcukino vadanti} (be informed of what these guards are telling). On the other hand Kathâs. 39, 87 <skt>tasyai sarvam… abravīt / yo ‘sau yannāmadheyaś ca yasya putro mahīpateḥ} (he told her everything, who he was, of what name, whose king’s son), the direct question would have been <skt>kas tvaṃ kiṃ nāmadheyaś ca kasya putraḥ}. Likewise Mâlat. II, p. 39 <skt>pitaiva te jānāti yo ‘sau yādṛśaś ca}, R. 2, 52, 60 <skt>śṛṇu… yadarthaṃ tvāṃ preṣayāmi purīmitaḥ}.</p>
