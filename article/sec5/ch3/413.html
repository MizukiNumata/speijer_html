    <p>On the other hand, <skt>na} put into the question announces an affirmative answer, like Latin <i>nonne</span>. It generally attends some interrogative particle, viz. <skt>api} or <skt>kim}, but may also be used by itself. By combining <skt>na} and <skt>nu} one gets <skt>nanu} which is to be considered a new particle, fully answering to Lat. <i>nonne</span>, Greek <i>οὐκοῦν</span>, and which for this reason has also the force of an emphatic (396). Examples: Ch. Up. 1, 10, 4 <skt>na svid ete ‘py ucchiṣṭā iti} (were not these [beans] also left [and therefore unclean]?); — R. 2, 72, 5 <skt>api nādhvaśramaḥ śīghraṃ rathenāpatatas tava} (are you not tired with the long way, having driven quickly?); — Ratn. III, p. 79 <skt>kiṃ padmasya ruciṃ na hanti nayanānandraṃ vidhatte na kim} [viz. <skt>vaktrendustava}] (does not [the splendour of your face] outshine the brilliancy of the white lotus and does it not cause delight to the eyes?); — R. 2, 22, 22 <skt>nanu daivasya karma tat} (is not that the effect of Destiny?).</p>
