    <p>435. 1. the demonstrative.</p>
    <p>1. As to the <b>demonstrative</span>, some instances have been given 275. I add one more from the beginning of the Pancatantra <skt>asti dākṣiṇātye janapade mahilāropyaṃ nāma nagaram / tatra… amaraśaktir nāma rājā babhūva / tasya trayaḥ putrāḥ… babhūvaḥ}. Nothing prevents the employment of both dem. pronoun and particle together. So often <skt>so ‘pi}.</p>
    <p>The acc. neuter <skt>tat} and the abl. neuter <skt>tasmāt}, when = „therefore, for this reason,” have wholly got the nature of particles. Likewise <skt>tena}.</p>
