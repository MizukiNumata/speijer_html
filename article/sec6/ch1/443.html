    <p>443. hi, the causal particle.</p>
    <p>The causal particle is <skt>hi} (429). It may be compared with Greek <i>γάρ</span>, since like this it has a rather general employment when annexing sentences which contain some motive, reason, cause or even a mere illustration of that which precedes. For this reason, it may sometimes be rendered by „for” or „because” or „since,” sometimes with less emphasis, sometimes it is not to be translated at all. At the outset it was, indeed, a mere affirmative particle. Viddhaç. I, p. 7 <skt>śriyaḥ pradugdhe vipado ruṇaddhi yaśāṃsi sūte malinaṃ pramārṣṭi / saṃskāraśaucena paraṃ punīte śuddhā hi buddhiḥ kila kāmadhenuḥ} (pure wisdom is indeed a cow of plenty; it milks blessings, it repels mishap, it produces glory, it cleanses the dirty, etc.) Kâd. I, p. 20 the king has declared his astonishment at the great gift of speech of the parrot which has been offered to him; in reply to this he is told <skt>kim atra citram / ete hi śukaśārikāprabhṛtayo vihaṅgaviśeṣā yathāśrutaṃ vācamuccārayanti} (why wonder at this? since parrots, magpies and the like birds well repeat the words they have heard), Hit. 4 <skt>āhāranidrābhayamaithunaṃ ca sāmānyametatpaśubhir narāṇām / dharmo hi teṣām udhiko viśeṣo dharmeṇa hīnāḥ paśubhiḥ samānāḥ}.</p>
    <p>For the rest, if it be necessary to signify the cause or motive as such, the relatives <skt>yataḥ} and <skt>yasmāt} are used. See 467.</p>
