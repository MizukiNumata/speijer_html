    <p>Especially <skt>tat} is exceedingly frequent, and in drawing inferences it is always added.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In the archaic dialect many other accus. neuters of demonstrative pronouns were to some extent used as particle: <skt>etat}, <skt>adaḥ}, <skt>idam} almost = <skt>evam}, <skt>ittham}, <skt>iti}. See f. i. Ait. Br. 1, 9, 6; 14, 6; Ch. Up. 4, 2, 1; 6, 8, 3.</p>
    <p>Even the pronoun <skt>sa}, when conjoined with another pronoun, especially a personal one, may import a conclusive meaning. Mhbh. 1, 146, 29 Yudhishthira advising his brothers that it is necessary to keep themselves hidden from Duryodhana, concludes thus <skt>te vayaṃ mṛgayāśīlāś carāma vasudhām imām} (let us <i>therefore</span> ramble over this country, being intent on hunting), Çâk. II Dushyanta is requested by hie mother to return to his capital, but be wants to remain in the hermitage, to defend which from the evil spirits be bas been entreated by the hermits; now he decides to stay there himself and to send his vidûshaka home in his stead, with these words <skt>sakhe mādhavya tvam apy ambābhiḥ putra iva gṛhītaḥ sa bhavānitaḥ pratinivṛtya… tatrabhavatīnāṃ putrakāryam anuṣṭhātum arhati} (friend M., my mother treats you too as a son, <i>therefore</span>, do yon go back home —), Utt. I, p. 11 Sîtâ perceives the portrait of the deity Gangâ; Rama praises the deity and concludes <skt>sā tvam amba… sītāyāṃ śivān udhyān aparā bhava} (be, then, mother, propitious to Sîtâ). Another instance illustrative of this idiom is Ragh. 1, 5, but it is too long to be quoted, for to translate it correctly the whole passage would have to be given. Cp. also Mhbh. 1, 153, 4.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. Occasionally <skt>sa} is used so, even without the personal pronoun added. Daç. 141 <skt>putra mayāsi jātamātraḥ pāpayā parityaktaḥ / sa kim artham evaṃ mām atinirghṛṇām anugṛhṇāsi} (I have abandoned you, my son, as soon as you were born, why, <i>then</span>, do you welcome thus your cruel mother?). Cp. f. i. Ait. Br. l, 7, 3 <skt>sā vai vo varaṃ vṛṇai}.</p>
