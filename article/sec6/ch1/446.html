    <p>446. tathâpi.</p>
    <p><i>Nevertheless</span>, <i>however</span>, <i>yet</span> is <skt>tathāpi}. It commonly introduces the apodosis after a concessive protasis (483), but sometimes it may usher in a new sentence, as Panc. 332 <skt>bhoḥ satyam etad daivānukūlatayā sarvaṃ kalyāṇaṃ saṃpadyate / tathāpi puruṣeṇa satāṃ vacanaṃ kāryam} (it cannot be denied, that every success occurs according to Destiny, nevertheless a man ought to perform the prescriptions of the good), cp. 315, l. 22.</p>
