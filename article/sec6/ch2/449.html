    <p>When subordinating some fact or action to some other one, there are two different manners for bringing this relation to grammatical expression, either by synthesis or by analysis. The synthetic expression takes up the clauses into the frame of the chief sentence, while denoting them by verbal nouns or nominal forms of the verb, as participles, gerunds, infinitives and the like. Then, the sentence contains but one finite verb significative of the principal action, the other actions appearing in the shape of nouns and nominal forms which by their noun-cases and modalities are to represent the relations existing between the main action and the secondary ones. By the analytic structure, on the contrary, both the principal and the subordinate fact are evolved into full sentences, either of them containing its finite verb. Then, the clause is marked by a relative, which by its form or its referring to some demonstrative, or even by the place occupied by it, points out the chief sentence on which it depends. A relative sentence by itself is nonsense, it demands some main sentence to depend upon, of which it is logically but a detached link.</p>
    <p>Exactly speaking, it is the analytic expression alone that constitutes <i>subordination of sentences</span>. The synthetical expression of clauses does not create new sentences. For this reason, the participles etc. are no subject-matter of this chapter, and have been dealt with in Section IV.</p>
    <p>In Sanskrit both modes have been used from time immemorial. We have no evidence to decide which may be the oldest. For the rest, the relative system stands to participles, infinitives etc., almost as prepositions to noun-cases, as auxiliaries to verbal flection.</p>
