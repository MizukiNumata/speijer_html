    <p>451. The relative system.</p>
    <p>Subordinate sentences, then, are characterized by <b>relatives</span>. By this name I designate the pronoun <skt>ya} with all its derivatives, whether they may be called pronouns as <skt>yaH} (who), <skt>yAvat} (Lat. <i>quantus</span>), <skt>yAdRzaH} (Lat. <i>qualis</span>), or pronominal adverbs as <skt>yataH} (whence), <skt>yatra} (where), <skt>yathA} (as), and conjunctions as <skt>yadi} (if). They have in common the property of referring to some demonstrative, either expressed or implied in the main sentence. Such a couple of relative and demonstrative, standing one in the clause the other in the main sentence, may be compared to a system of hook and eye holding together two different parts of a piece of cloth. Of the kind are <skt>yaH… sa}, <skt>yAdRzaH… tAdRzaH}, <skt>yatra… tatra}, <skt>yadA… tadA}, <skt>yadi… tataH} or <skt>tadA} or <skt>atha} etc.</p>
