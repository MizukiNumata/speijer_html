    <p>461. Relative adverbs.</p>
    <p>Some noun-cases of <skt>ya} may be used quite adverbially and even assume the nature of conjunctions, as <skt>yat}, <skt>yena}, <skt>yataH} and <skt>yasmAt}, moreover <skt>yAvat} and <skt>yAvatAM}. With them rank such as are derived by means of adverbial suffixes, <skt>yathA}, <skt>yadA}, <skt>yadi}. All of them serve to introduce various kinds of clauses and subordinate sentences. If we except <skt>yadA}, restricted to temporal clauses, and <skt>yadi} exclusively employed in conditional and hypothetical protases, we cannot say that each of the named conjunctions has its own logical sphere of employment. So for instance, <skt>yat} may sometimes express a reason, sometimes a circumstance, now it points to a purpose, now it merely paraphrases a fact. Similarly <skt>yAvat} may be time-denoting or it may indicate a proportion. And so on.</p>
