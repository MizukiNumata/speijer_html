    <p>462. yat.</p>
    <p><skt>yat} and the rest have nearly the character of such conjunctions as Lat. <i>quod</span> and <i>quo</span>, Engl. <i>that</span>. At the outset they were cases of the neuter of the pronoun. Compare f. i. these two sentences : Kumâras. 4, 9 <skt>yad avocas tad avaimi kaitavam} (that which you said, I understand it to be falsehood) with Çâk. V <skt>yanmithaH samayAdimAM madIyAM duhitaraM bhavAnupAyaMsta tanmayA prItimatA yuvayoranujJAtam} (that you have wedded my daughter by mutual agreement, I forgive it both of you). In the former, <skt>yat} is the acc. of the pronoun and expresses the object of the relative sentence, in the latter it is a mere conjunction serving to introduce the periphrase of the subject of the main sentence, expressed by the demonstr. <skt>tat}, but it is no <i>essential</span> element of the proposition.</p>
