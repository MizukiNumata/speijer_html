    <p>467. yataḥ and yasmât.</p>
    <p>Of Z and Z the causal employment is more strongly marked than of Z. They not only denote the reason, but also the efficient and material cause: <i>for</span>, <i>because</span>. The period is sometimes expressed in full Z, Z sim., sometimes the demonstrative is not added. Panc. III, 105 Z (<i>since</span> the wise have declared clemency the highest virtue, one must protect even the smallest insects), ibid. p. 107 Z, ibid. 72 Z (this does not hold good, because —), cp. Kathâs. 30, 39. — Both Z and Z are excessively frequent, when adding the causes to facts already mentioned before. Then they are concurrent with Z, and like this, they may be said to serve for coordination rather than subordination. F. i. Panc. 241 Z (it is good for us, that Rakâxa is gone, for he is wise but these [others] are stupid).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. With the same function are used the full phrases Z and the like. Panc. 216 Z (yon must not stay with us, for we have taken possesion of this lake), ibid. 218 Z = Lat <i>nam</span> supplex non interficitur.</p>
