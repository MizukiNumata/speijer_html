    <p>468. yena.</p>
    <p>The conjunction <skt>yena} is chiefly expressive of purpose or intention. One might, therefore, expect it to be construed with the optative or the future, and indeed so it is, yet the present is oftener employed, especially in simple prose. The same applies to <skt>yathA}, when a final particle, see 471.</p>

    <p>When the demonstrative precedes, the sentence introduced by <skt>yena} may be also a consecutive one, as it points to the direct consequence of the action signified by the main sentence. Kathâs. 12, 100 <skt>tathA kuru yena saH / gRhAnmama nivarteta} (act <i>so that</span> he will retire from my house), Hit. 10 the tiger speaks <skt>mama caitAvAnlobhaviraho yena svahastasthamapi suvarNakaGkaNaM yasmai kasmaicid dAtum icchAmi} (I am <i>so</span> free from covetousness, <i>as</span> to wish to give —).</p>
