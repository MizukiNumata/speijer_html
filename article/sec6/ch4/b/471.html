    <p>471. <i>b</span>) final and consecutive.</p>
    <p><i>b.</span>) <skt>yathA} points to the result, either effected or aimed at. The <i>result effected</span> is set forth by <skt>yathA} construed with a past tense and preceded by <skt>tathA}. The <i>result aimed at</span> or (what is often identical) the <i>purpose</span> is expressed by <skt>yathA} construed with an optative (<skt>liG}), a future or, as is oftener done, a present (cp. 468). In both categories of sentences the demonstrative <skt>tathA} is generally added.</p>
    <p>Examples: 1. <skt>yathA} points to the result effected. Kathâs. 25, 120 <skt>krameNa ca yayau tatra prakarSaM sa tathA yathA / ajIyata na kenApi pratimallena bhUtale} (and by degrees he became <i>such</span> a master in this art [boxing], <i>that</span> no adversary on earth could vanquish him), Panc. 318 <skt>evaM tena dhyAnasthitena tathaiva pAdaprahAro datto yathA sa ghaTo bhagnaH} (as he was thinking so, he gave the pot <i>such</span> a kick <i>that</span> it broke). See also Kumâras. 5, 15.</p>
    <p>2. <skt>yathA} signifies the result aimed at, the purpose. Here the present usually follows. Panc. 2 <skt>yathA mama manorathAH siddhiM yAnti tathAnuSThIyatAm} (act <i>so as to</span> cause my wishes to be fulfilled), Kathâs. 26, 42 <skt>yuvAM me kurutaM tathA yathAhamadya pazyAmi tAM yuSmatsvAminIm iha} (cause me to see your queen to-day), Panc. 151 <skt>ahaM tathA bhakSayAmi yathA bahUnyahAni me prANayAtrA bhavati} (I will eat [of it] <i>in such a way</span>, <i>as to</span> be supported by it for many days), Çâk. I <skt>AzramabAdhA yathA na bhavati tathAhamapi yatiSye} (I too will take care, <i>that</span> there may be done no harm to the hermitage), Hit. 108 <skt>yathAyaM nazyati tanmayA vidheyam}. — Yet, the optative (<skt>liG}) is also found, especially in ornate style and in ancient literature. Mhbh. 1, 163, 8 <skt>yathA tvidaM na vindeyurnarA nagaravAsinaH / tathAyaM brAhmaNo vAcyaH} (but this brahman should be warned, that the townsmen may not become aware of it), Kathâs. 13, 55 <skt>sa cAputro bahUnviprAnsaMghATya praNato ‘bravIt / tathA kuruta putro me yathA syAd acirAd iti}, Vikram. II, p. 38 <skt>tadupAyazcintyatAM yathA saphalaprArthano bhaveyam}. — Instance of the future: Panc. 105 <skt>mayAnyonyaM tAbhyAM… bhedastathA vihito yathA bhUyo ‘pi mantrayantAvekasthAnasthitau na drakSyasi} (I have made them so discordant that you will see them never more deliberate together).</p>
    <p>The future is of course wanted, if the main sentence has a future. Nala. 1, 20 <skt>damayantIsakAze tvAM kathayiSyAmi naiSadha / yathA tvadanyaM puruSaM na sA maMsyati karhicit}, Likewise the optative, if the main sentence has an optative. Daç. 138 <skt>tathA viSaM stambhayeyaM yathA mRta ityudAsyeta} (I will arrest the poison, but in such a manner, that he will be left for dead).</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. If the demonstrative is not added, <skt>yathA} = »[in order] that.” Panc. 56 <skt>saMbodhyo ‘dya tvayA nijabhartA yathA mama zatrUn vyApAdayati} (you must exhort your husband, that he may kill my enemies). Cp. Nala. 1, 20.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 2. Instead of <skt>yathA na} with optative, epic poets often use the simple <skt>na} (405 R. 1). Moreover, <skt>mA} may be = »lest,” when it agrees with aorist or with optative, in epic poetry even with the future, cp. 405 R. 1. — In affirmative sentences the omission of <skt>yathA} is very rare, yet there are instances of it. R. 1, 39, 11 <skt>tattathA kriyatAM rAjanyajJo ‘chidraH kRto bhavet} (make the sacrifice to be accomplished without flaw).</p>
