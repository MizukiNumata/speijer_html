    <p>473. d) yathâ, when a causal particle.</p>
    <p><i>d.</span>) Finally, <skt>yathA} may sometimes have the nature of a causal particle. This seems to have been more usual in ancient literature, than afterwards. Ch. Up. 6, 13, 1 <skt>uddhAvamRzya na viveda yathA vilInamevAGga} (he [the son] having looked for it [the salt, he had placed in the water] did not find it, <i>for</span>, of course, it was melted), R. 3, 57, 19 Râma surmises, Sîtâ will have incurred some harm. <skt>sarvathA janakAtmajA / vinaSTA bhakSitA vApi rAkSasair anacAribhiH / azubhAnyeva bhUyiSThaM yathA prAdurbhavanti me} (— as it is chiefly prognostics of evil, that appear to me).</p>
    <p>This causal meaning of <skt>yathA} is sometimes indicated by adding <skt>hi} the exponent of causality. R. 3, 11, 47 <skt>etadevAzramapadaM nUnaM tasya… agastyasya muner bhrAturdRzyate… yathA hIme vanasyAsya jJAtAH pathi sahasrazaH… drumAH}.</p>
    <p>In the instances quoted the clause with <skt>yathA} follows the main sentence. If it precedes, we may translate it by <i>as much as</span>, <i>considering</span>, etc. Nala. 21, 8 <skt>yathAsau rathanirghoSaH pUrayanniva medinIm / mamAhlAdayate ceto nala eSa mahIpatiH} (<i>considering</span> the joy, which causes to me the sound of the chariot, I know it is Nala).</p>
