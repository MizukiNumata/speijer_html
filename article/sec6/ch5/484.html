    <p>484. Conditional period.</p>
    <p>The conditional period is a compound sentence, made up of a protasis and an apodosis. The protasis contains period. the condition, whereas the apodosis states what will happen under the said condition.</p>

    <p>{yadi and cet.}</p>
    <p>The grammatical exponents of the protasis are <skt>yadi} or <skt>cet}. Of these, <skt>yadi} since it is a relative, heads the sentence, at least in prose. But, as a rule, <skt>cet} is not put at the head, it is often the last word of the sentence; yet, <skt>sa}, <skt>eSa}, <skt>na} sim. being used, it is put close after them.</p>

    <p>{Correlative demonstratives in the apodosis.}</p>
    <p>In the apodosis no correlative is necessary. Yet it is often expressed, viz. <skt>tataH} or <skt>tadA} or <skt>tat} or <skt>tarhi}, occationally <skt>atha}.</p>

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 1. In most cases the protasis precedes. Sometimes, however, the main sentence is put first, f. i. Daç. 91 <skt>ajinaratnaM mayA tubhyaM deyaM yadi pratidAnaM rAgamaJjarI} (I am bound to deliver you the magic skin, provided that Râgamanjarî be given in return to me), Kâd.

    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. 3. The combination <skt>yadi cet} is sometimes round in epic poetry, f. i. R. 2, 48, 21, Mhbh. 1, 104, 37. In fact, <skt>cet} has not been at the outset a conjunction, nor is it a relative, though in the classic dialect it may bear this character. It is properly a combination of <skt>ca} + <skt>it} the emphatic particle (398 R. 2) (*1). In the archaic dialect even the simple <skt>ca} does occasional duty as a conditional particle (*2).</p>
