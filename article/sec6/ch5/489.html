    <p>Conditional periods of the third category require the employment of the optative (<skt>liG}); if they are, however, expressive of a supposition, which cannot be realized because the proper time has already passed, the conditional is also available, cp. 347,</p>
    <p>Examples: 1st category. Çâk. V <skt>yadi yathA vadati kSitipas tathA tvam asi kiM pitur utkulayA tvayA / atha tu vetsi zuci vratamAtmanaH patikule tava dAsyam api kSamam}, here the present tense is expressive of present time: »if you really are… , but if you are knowing;” — Panc. 278 the minister’s wife makes this condition to her husband <skt>yadi ziro muNDayitvA mama pAdayor nipatasi tadA prasAdAbhimukhI bhavAmi} (if you fall at my feet with shaven head, I will be kind again), here the present tense signifies something to be fulfilled in the future. But ibid. 113 <skt>yadi tvam asya mantrI bhavaSyasi tadAnyo ‘pi kazcinnAsya samIpe sAdhujanaH sameSyati} (if you shall be his minister, then no other honest man will come near him) the future tense is used of future action. Likewise Nala. 20, 15 <skt>kAmaM ca te kariSyAmi yanmAM vakSyasi bAhuka vidarbhAn yadi yAtvAdya sUryaM darzayitAsi me} there is a future in both the conditional clause and the main sentence. Cp. 341*.</p>
    <p class="rem" id="hoge">Rem. In conditional periods of this category the <skt>liG} is wanted, if for some accessory reason there be a tendency for employing it, f. i. in suppositions of a general bearing (343 <i>e</span>), as Varâh. Yog. 1, 4 <skt>syAc chidram ekam api cet tata eva sarvaM nAzaM prayAti} (if but one [of the aforesaid conditions for the success of a prince] be deficient, the whole perishes).</p>
    <p>2d category. Mhbh. 3, 297 , 98 Sâvitrî prays <skt>yadi me ‘sti tapastaptaM yadi dattaM hutaM yadi / zvazrUzvazurabhartRRNAM mama puNyAstu zarvarI} (if I have done penance, bestowed gifts and poured out libations — [and so I have] — this night may be propitious —), Mrcch. III, p. 121 <skt>yadi tAvat kRtAn tena praNayo ‘rtheSu kRtaH / kim idAnIM nRzaMsena cAritramapi dRSitam} (if thou hast loved till now my fortune only, why, destructive Fate, hast thou now without mercy profaned my virtuous name?).</p>
    <p>3d category. Mrcch III, p. 113 <skt>dIpaM na marSayedabhimukhaM syAllakSyasuptaM yadi [sc. dvayam]} (nor would they bear the light being brought near to them, if they only feigned to sleep), R. 2, 67, 36 <skt>aho tama ivedaM syAn na prajJAyeta kiMcana / rAjA cen na bhavelloke vibhajansAdhvasAdhunI} (darkness as it were would be on earth, and nothing would be discernible, if no king were in the world, to discriminate between good and evil), Kumâras. 6, 61 <skt>kartavyaM vo na pazyAmi syAc cet kiM nopapadyate} (I know nothing, I could do for you; if there should be, all is granted). Other instances of <skt>liG} see 343 <i>d</span>), instances of conditional 347.</p>
