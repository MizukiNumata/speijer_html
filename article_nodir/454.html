          <h2>454.</h2>

          <p>
            In general propositions, the relative sentence is not rarely characterized by two or more different relatives placed close together. When translating them, all of them, or at least all but one, become indefinites or must be rendered in some different way. <span data-fontsize="small">Panc. V, 9 <skt>yasya yadā vibhavaḥ syāt tasya tadā dāsatāṃ yānti</skt> (if a person is wealthy for some time, they become his servants for so long), M. 7, 96 <skt>yo yaj jayati tasya tat</skt> (that which one captures, is one’s own), Pat. I, p. 123 <skt>gāvo divasaṃ caritavatyo yo yasyāḥ prasavo bhavati tena saha śerate</skt> (the cows when having grazed by day-time, lie during the night each with her own calf), Panc. 1. 48 <skt>yo na vetti guṇānyasya na taṃ seveta paṇḍitaḥ</skt> (a wise man must not attend on such a one, as does not know his qualities), Hit. 106 <skt>yo yatra kuśalaḥ kārye taṃ tatra viniyojayet</skt>.</span>
